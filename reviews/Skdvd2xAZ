We will address a few specific points that you raised in the following:\n\n\n>In this respect, I think that the novelty in the current submission is limited, as the approximation is essentially what proposed in Botev et al., ICML 2017.  The Laplace approximation requires the Hessian of the posterior, so techniques developed for Gauss-Newton optimization can straightforwardly be applied to construct Laplace approximations.\n\nWe fully agree that, from a techincal perspective, the approximation to the Hessian is not new and that once the two Kronecker factors are calculated it is relatively straightforward (in terms of implementation) to calculate the approximate predicive mean for a network. However, we do think that introducing these ideas from the optimisation literature to the Bayesian deep learning community, demonstrating how the Laplace approximation can be scaled to neural networks, is indeed a novel and valuable contribution (since the diagonal approximation is not sufficient as shown in our experiments and the full approximation is not feasible). The Laplace approximation fundamentelly differs from the currently popular variational inference approaches in not requiring a modification to the training procedure, which is extremely useful for practictioners as they can simply apply it to their exisiting networks/do not need to do a full new hyperparameter search for optimising the parameters of an approximate posterior.\n\n\n>I think it would have been interesting to report comparisons with factorized variational inference (Graves, 2011) as it is a fairly standard and widely adopted in Bayesian deep learning. This would have been an interesting way to support the claims on the poor approximation offered by standard variational inference. \n\nWe have added this baseline to the 2nd and 3rd experiment, as this was also requested by Reviewer 1 (our original aim was to have a \"clean\" comparison that is independent of the optimisation objective/procedure by focusing on different prediction methods for an identical network). \n\n\n>I believe that the independence assumption across layers is a limiting factor of the proposed approximation strategy. Intuitively, changes in the weights in a given layer should affect the weights in other layers, so I would expect the posterior distribution over all the weights to reflect this through correlations across layers. I wonder how these results can be generalized to relax the independence assumption.\n\nThank you for this suggestion. Indeed, the layerwise blocks of the Fisher and Gauss-Newton are all Kronecker factored, so it should be possible to include the covariance of e.g. neighbouring layers in a computationally efficient way. In their work on KFAC, Martens & Grosse investigated such a tri-diagonal block approximation of the Fisher, however this only gave a minor improvment in performance over the block-diagonal approximation. Yet, since optimisation is a lot more time-critical, this could be worth investigating in the future for the Laplace approximation."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"A Scalable Laplace Approximation for Neural Networks","abstract":"We leverage recent insights from second-order optimisation for neural networks to construct a Kronecker factored Laplace approximation to the posterior over the weights of a trained network.

Mixed results and perhaps not currently fulfilling its full potential as a paper.","rating":"6: Marginally above acceptance threshold","review":"This paper uses recent progress in the understanding and approximation of curvature matrices in neural networks to revisit a venerable area- that of Laplace approximations to neural network posteriors. The Laplace method requires two stages - 1) obtaining a point estimate of the parameters followed by 2) estimation of the curvature. Since 1) is close to common practice it raises the appealing possibility of adding 2) after the fact, although the prior may be difficult to interpret in this case. A pitfall is that the method needs the point estimate to fall in a locally quadratic bowl or to add regularisation to make this true. The necessary amount of regularisation can be large as reported in section 5.4.\n\nThe paper is generally well written. In particular the mathematical exposition attains good clarity. Much of the mathematical treatment of the curvature was already discussed by Martens and Grosse and Botev et al in previous works. The paper is generally well referenced. \n\nGiven the complexity of the method, I think it would have helped to submit the code in anonymized form at this point.There are also some experiments not there that would improve the contribution. Figure 1 should include a comparison to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and the full Laplace approximation (It is not sufficient to point to experiments in Hernandez-Lobato and Adams 2015 with a different model/prior). The size of model and data would not be prohibitive for either of these methods in this instance. All that figure 1 shows at the moment is that the proposed approximation has smaller predictive variance than the fully diagonal variant of the method. \n\nIt would be interesting (but perhaps not essential) to compare the Laplace approximation to other scalable methods from the literature such as that of Louizos and Welling 2016 which uses also used matrix normal distributions. It is good that the paper includes a modern architecture with a more challenging dataset. It is a shame the method does not work better in this instance but the authors should not be penalized for reporting this. I think a paper on a probabilistic method should at some point evaluate log likelihood in a case where the test distribution is the same as the training distribution. This complements experiments where there is dataset shift and we wish to show robustness. I would be very interested to know how useful the implied marginal likelihoods of the approximation where, as suggested for further work in the conclusion.\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"A Scalable Laplace Approximation for Neural Networks","abstract":"We leverage recent insights from second-order optimisation for neural networks to construct a Kronecker factored Laplace approximation to the posterior over the weights of a trained network.
