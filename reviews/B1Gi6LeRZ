However, our method is novel in that we change the objective of training by training the model to output the mixing ratio, which is fundamentally a different idea from previous data augmentation methods. The novelty or key point of our method is not mixing multiple sounds, but rather learning method of training the model to output the mixing ratio. That is why we represent our method as \"learning method.\" We intuitively describe why such a learning method is effective in Section 3.3 and demonstrate the effectiveness of BC learning through wide-ranging experiments.\n\n- Regarding comparison with other data augmentation methods:\nFirst, we compared BC learning with other data augmentation methods that mix multiple sounds in ablation analysis (see Table 2), and showed that our method of mixing just two classes with equation 2 and training the model to output the mixing ratio performs the best.\n\nSecond, our BC learning can be combined with any data augmentation methods that do not mix multiple sounds by mixing two augmented data. In Section 4.1.3, we demonstrated that BC learning is even \"compatible\" with a strong data augmentation, which we believe is more important than being \"stronger\" than that. This data augmentation method uses scale and amplitude augmentation similar to Salamon & Bello (2017) in addition to padding and cropping, and thus, it is close to the state-of-the-art level. As shown in Table 1, the error rates of DSRNet when using only BC learning (18.2%, 10.6%, and 23.4% on ESC-50, ESC-10, and UrbanSound8K, respectively) were lower than those when using the strong data augmentation (21.2%, 10.9%, and 24.9%). Furthermore, as a result of combination of BC learning and the strong data augmentation, we achieved a further higher performance (15.1%, 8.6%, and 21.7%). In this way, we demonstrated the strongness and compatibility of BC learning with other data augmentation techniques through various experiments.\n\nHere, we assume that the effect of BC learning is even strengthened when using a stronger data augmentation scheme. Because the potential within-class variance becomes large when using a strong data augmentation, the overlap between the feature distribution of each class and that of mixed sounds tends to become large and it becomes more difficult for model to output the mixing ratio (see also Fig. 2). Therefore, the effect of enlargement of Fisher’s criterion would become stronger.\n\n- Regarding the limitation of BC learning:\nThanks for your advice. What you have pointed out is correct. However, the dimension of the feature space d is generally designed to be larger than the number of classes c (e.g., EnvNet/DSRNet: 4096; SoundNet: 256; M18: 512; and Logmel-CNN: 5000). If d < c-1, the features cannot sufficiently represent categorical information, and the model would not be able to achieve a good performance. We have tried to train an EnvNet whose dimension of fully connected layer was made less than 49 on ESC-50 with standard learning, but the loss did not begin to decrease. It is not a matter of BC learning. Furthermore, even if there is a network whose d is smaller than c-1, BC learning would enlarge Fisher's criterion and regularize the positional relationship as much as possible. Therefore, we do not think it is an important limitation of BC learning.\n\n\nThanks for other helpful comments. We will reflect them to the final version. Note than we showed the correspondence with a semantic feature space by visualizing the features of mixed sounds in Fig. 3."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Learning from Between-class Examples for Deep Sound Recognition","abstract":"Deep learning methods have achieved high performance in sound recognition tasks.

We hypothesize that the ratio of auditory perception for the network is the same as the ratio of amplitude, and define p so that the auditory perception of the mixed sound becomes r: (1-r). This is because the main component functions of CNNs, such as conv/fc, relu, max pooling, and average pooling, satisfy homogeneity (i.e., f(ax) = af(x)) if we ignore the bias. We will clarify the derivation and meaning of equation 2.\n\n- Regarding how to extend BC learning to other modalities:\nWe assume that BC learning can also be applied to image classification. Image data can be treated as 2-D waveforms along x- and y- axis that contain various areas of frequency information in quite a similar manner to sound data. In addition, recent studies on speech/sound recognition have demonstrated that each filter of CNNs learns to respond to a particular frequency area (e.g., Sainath et al., 2015b). Considering them, we assume that CNNs have aspect of recognizing images by treating them as waveforms in a similar manner to how they recognize sounds, and what works on sounds must also work on images. A simple mixing method (r x_1 + (1-r) x_2) would work well, but we assume that a mixing method that treats the images as waveforms (similar to equation 2) leads to a further performance improvement.\n\n- Regarding mixing more than two classes:\nMixing more than two classes would have a similar effect to mixing just two classes. However, the number of class combinations dramatically increases, and it would become difficult to train. Mixing just two classes can directory impose a constraint on the feature distribution (as we describe in Section 3.3). Therefore, we assume that mixing just two classes is the most efficient. Experimental results also show that mixing two classes performs better than mixing three classes (see Table 2).\n\nThanks for other helpful comments.

The manuscript motivates the necessity of such technique and presents the basic intuition. The authors show how the so-called BC learning helps training different deep architectures for the sound recognition task.\n\nMy first remark regards the presentation of the technique. The authors argue that it is not a data augmentation technique, but rather a learning method. I strongly disagree with this statement, not only because the technique deals exactly with augmenting data, but also because it can be used in combination to any learning method (including non-deep learning methodologies). Naturally, the literature review deals with data augmentation technique, which supports my point of view.\n\nIn this regard, I would have expected comparison with other state-of-the-art data augmentation techniques. The usefulness of the BC technique is proven to a certain extent (see paragraph below) but there is not comparison with state-of-the-art. In other words, the authors do not compare the proposed method with other methods doing data augmentation. This is crucial to understand the advantages of the BC technique.\n\nThere is a more fundamental question for which I was not able to find an explicit answer in the manuscript. Intuitively, the diagram shown in Figure 4 works well for 3 classes in dimension 2. If we add another class, no matter how do we define the borders, there will be one pair of classes for which the transition from one to another will pass through the region of a third class. The situation worsens with more classes. However, this can be solved by adding one dimension, 4 classes and 3 dimensions seems something feasible. One can easily understand that if there is one more class than the number of dimensions, the assumption should be feasible, but beyond it starts to get problematic. This discussion does not appear at all in the manuscript and it would be an important limitation of the method, specially when dealing with large-scale data sets.\n\nOverall I believe the paper is not mature enough for publication.\n\nSome minor comments:\n- 2.1: We introduce --> We discussion\n- Pieczak 2015a did not propose the extraction of MFCC.\n- the x_i and t_i of section 3.2.2 should not be denoted with the same letters as in 3.2.1.\n- The correspondence with a semantic feature space is too pretentious, specially since no experiment in this direction is shown.\n- I understand that there is no mixing in the test phase, perhaps it would be useful to recall it.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Learning from Between-class Examples for Deep Sound Recognition","abstract":"Deep learning methods have achieved high performance in sound recognition tasks.

Previous approaches to training data mixing are (1) from random classes, or (2) from the same class. The presented approach mixes sounds from specific pairs of classes to increase discriminative power of the final learned network. Results look like significant improvements over standard learning setups.\n\nDetailed Evaluation: The approach presented is simple, clearly presented, and looks effective on benchmarks. In terms of originality, it is different from warping training example for the same task and it is a good extension of previously suggested example mixing procedures with a targeted benefit for improved discriminative power. The authors have also provided extensive analysis from the point of views (1) network architecture, (2) mixing method, (3) number of labels / classes in mix, (4) mixing layers -- really well done due-diligence across different model and task parameters.\n\nMinor Asks:\n(1) Clarification on how the error rates are defined. Especially since the standard learning task could be 0-1 loss and this new BC learning task could be based on distribution divergence (if we're not using argmax as class label).\n(2) #class_pairs targets as analysis - The number of epochs needed is naturally going to be higher since the BC-DNN has to train to predict mixing ratios between pairs of classes. Since pairs of classes could be huge if the total number of classes is large, it'll be nice to see how this scales. I.e. are we talking about a space of 10 total classes or 10000 total classes? How does num required epochs get impacted as we increase this class space?\n(3) Clarify how G_1/20 and G_2/20 is important / derived - I assume it's unit conversion from decibels.\n(4) Please explain why it is important to use the smoothed average of 10 softmax predictions in evaluation... what happens if you just randomly pick one of the 10 crops for prediction?","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Learning from Between-class Examples for Deep Sound Recognition","abstract":"Deep learning methods have achieved high performance in sound recognition tasks.
