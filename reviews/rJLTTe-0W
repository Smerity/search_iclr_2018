We have made changes following your suggestions. Please see below for our response point by point. Thank you.\n\n\nThe paper introduces a Bayesian model for timeseries with anomaly and change points besides regular trend and seasonality. It develops algorithms for inference and forecasting. The performance is evaluated and compared against state-of-the-art methods on three data sets: 1) synthetic data obtained from the generative Bayesian model itself; 2) well-log data; 3) internet traffic data.\n\n>> Thanks for the appreciation of our work. \n\nFrom a practical perspective, one cannot expect this contribution to be ground-breaking, since there has been more than 40 years of work on time series forecasting, change point and anomaly detection. In some situations the methodology proposed here will work better than previous approaches (particularly in the situation where the data comes from the Bayesian model itself - in that case, there clearly is no better approach), in other cases (which the paper might have put less emphasis on), previous approaches will work better. To position this kind of work, I think it is important the authors discuss the limitations of their approach. \n\n>> As most (if not all) of the time series works, our method cannot work in every case. For example, when the time series does not have clear decomposition structure as modeled in Eqs.(1-3), the model may not correctly recover the hidden components and correspondingly perform forecasting.\n\nSome guidelines on when or when not to use it would be valuable. Clearly, these days one cannot introduce methodology in this area and expect it to outperform existing methods under all circumstances (and hence practitioners to always choose it over any other existing method).\n\nWhat is surprising is that relatively simple approaches like ETS or STL work pretty much equally well (in some cases even better in terms of MSE) than the proposed approach, while more recent approaches - like BSTS - dramatically fail. It would be good if the authors could comment on why this might be the case.\n\n>>  BSTS fails in some cases due to the mismatch between model assumptions and actual data distribution and generation process. Usually more complicated a model is, more likely it will fail when the data structure does not satisfy its underlying assumptions. In those cases, simple approaches may achieve better performance, which is not surprising. Nevertheless, our proposed method obtains the best result.\n\nSummary:\n+ Methodology appears to be a significant, solid contribution.\n- Experiments are not conclusive as to when or when not to choose this approach over existing methods\n- writing needs to be improved (large number of grammatical errors and typos, e.g. 'Methods')\n\n>> We will incorporate the discussions regarding model strength, application conditions, and the limitations in final version. \n>> We already fix the typos in updated version. \n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Bayesian Time Series Forecasting with Change Point and Anomaly Detection","abstract":"Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in marketing, finance and many other quantitative fields.

The authors propose an estimator that is computed by minimizing a deformed Bregman divergence. The authors prove that the proposed estimator is more computationally efficient and more robust than the maximal likelihood estimator (MLE), both in theory and simulation.  \n\n\nMajor Comments:\n\n1. After the definition 1, the likelihood $L(\\theta)$ is defined to be the sum of $\\log \\bar{q}_{\\theta}(x_i).$ Why the gradient of $L(\\theta)$ is a related to $\\tilde{p}$.\n\n2. After the equation (4), when the authors say $f=(U’)^{-1}$ the authors assume that the first order derivative of $U$ should be a strictly increasing function (otherwise the inverse function is not well defined, at least in classic notations). I would like to know whether we only need assume the convexity of $U$. Are there other assumptions?  \n\n3. In Proposition 1, I think the “Fisher consistent” means that (6) holds for any reasonable $U$ and $f$ just as the authors said before Proposition 1. It is better to add this in the statement of Proposition 1 too.  \n\n4. The “Proof 1” is better to be replaced with “Proof of Proposition 1” (same issues for “Proof 2”, “Proof 3”, etc). \n\n5. In the statement of Theorem 1, do the authors have any constraint for $U$?\n\n6. $\\xi_{U,f}$ appears in Theorem 2 without a clear definition. Even if it seems to be defined in (17), it is better to be defined again. \n\n7. Why Theorem 2 indicates that “the estimator (5) is not influenced so much by the outlier”?\n\n8. How to solve (5)? Is it trivial? I expect to see something like “We use … algorithm or toolbox to solve (5)“.   \n\nMinor Comments:\n\n1. In Example 2, I suggest use some more beautiful symbol like $\\top$ to denote the transpose instead of $T$. \n\n2. The length of the equations should not exceed the line-width (e.g., (4) and (7)). \n\n3. In page 5, “We find some examples satisfying 25 in Theorem 2”.

A large amount of methodologies has been developed on this topic, including ARIMA, Holt–Winters, etc. However, their performance is easily undermined by the existence of change points and anomaly points, two structures commonly observed in real data, but rarely considered in the aforementioned methods. In this paper, we propose a novel state space time series model, with the capability to capture the structure of change points and anomaly points, as well as trend and seasonality. To infer all the hidden variables, we develop a Bayesian framework, which is able to obtain distributions and forecasting intervals for time series forecasting, with provable theoretical properties. For implementation, an iterative algorithm with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Kalman filter and Kalman smoothing is proposed. In both synthetic data and real data applications, our methodology yields a better performance in time series forecasting compared with existing methods, along with more accurate change point detection and anomaly detection.","pdf":"/pdf/4f53203f9e2b36bd8d5d651b8289c9909dd3132a.pdf","TL;DR":"We propose a novel state space time series model with the capability to capture the structure of change points and anomaly points, so that it has a better forecasting performance when there exist change points and anomalies in the time series.","paperhash":"anonymous|bayesian_time_series_forecasting_with_change_point_and_anomaly_detection","_bibtex":"@article{\n  anonymous2018bayesian,\n  title={Bayesian Time Series Forecasting with Change Point and Anomaly Detection},\n  author={Anonymous},\n  journal={International Conference on Learning Representations},\n  year={2018},\n  url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJLTTe-0W}\n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper632/Authors"],"keywords":["Time Series Forecasting","Change Point Detection","Anomaly Detection","State Space Model","Bayesian"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":6,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"}],"limit":2000,"offset":0}
