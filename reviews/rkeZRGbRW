Methods whose discriminators tend to map inputs of a class to single real values are unable to provide a reliable learning signal for the generator, such as the standard GAN and Least Squares GAN. Variance in the discriminator’s output is essential to allow the generator to learn in the presence of a well-trained discriminator. To ensure the discriminator’s output follows the mixture of two univariate Gaussians, the authors proposed to add two additional discriminators which are trained in a similar was as the original GAN formulation. The technique is related to Linear Discriminant Analysis. From a broader perspective, the new meta-adversarial learning can be applied to ensure various desirable properties in GANs.\n\nThe performance of variance regularization scheme was evaluated on the CIFAR-10 and CelebA data.\n\nSummary:\n——\nI think the paper discusses a very interesting topic and presents an interesting direction for training the GANs. A few points are missing which would provide significantly more value to readers. See comments below for details and other points.\n\nComments:\n——\n1.\tWhy would a bi-modal distribution be meaningful? Deep nets implicitly transform the data which is probably much more effective than using complex bi-modal Gaussian distribution; the bi-modal concept can likely be captured using classical techniques.\n\n2.\tOn page 4, in Eq. (8) and (9), it remains unclear what $\\mathcal{R}$ and $\\mathcal{F}$ really are beyond two-layer MLPs; are the results of those two-layer MLPs used as the mean of a Gaussian distribution, i.e., $\\mu_r$ and $\\mu_f$?\n\n3.\tRegarding the description above Eq. (12), what is really used in practice, i.e., in the experiments? The paper omits many details that seem important for understanding. Could the authors provide more details on choosing the generator loss function and why Eq. (12) provides satisfying results in practice?    \n\nMinor Comments:\n——\n1.\tIn Sec 2.1, the sentence needs to be corrected: “As shown in Arjovsky & Bottou (2017), the JS divergence will be flat everywhere important if P and Q both lie on low-dimensional manifolds (as is likely the case with real data) and do not prefectly align.”\n\n2.\tLast sentence in Conclusion: “which can be applied to ensure enforce various desirable properties in GANs.” Please remove either “ensure” or “enforce.”\n","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Variance Regularizing Adversarial Learning","abstract":"We study how, in generative adversarial networks, variance in the discriminator's output affects the generator's ability to learn the data distribution.

The authors propose to use a discriminator whose output targets a mixture of two Gaussians (one component each for real and fake data).  The means and variances are fixed so that the discriminator does not overfit, which ensures that the generator learning is not hindered. \n\nThe discriminator itself is trained through two additional meta-discriminators (!) Are the meta-discriminators really necessary? Have you tried matching moments or using other methods for comparing the distributions?\n\nIt would be useful to write down the actual loss function so that it's easier to compare with other GAN variants. In particular, I'm curious to understand the difference between VRAL and Fisher-GAN. The authors discuss this in the end of Section 3, but a more careful comparison is needed.\n\nThe experimental results are pretty limited and lack detailed quantitative evaluation, which makes it harder to compare the performance of the proposed variant to existing algorithms.\n\nOverall, I think that the idea is interesting, but the paper needs more work and does not meet the ICLR acceptance bar.\n\nFYI, another concurrent submission showed that gradient penalties stabilize training of GANs:\nMANY PATHS TO EQUILIBRIUM: GANS DO NOT NEED TO DECREASE A DIVERGENCE AT EVERY STEP\nhttps://openreview.net/pdf?id=ByQpn1ZA-","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Variance Regularizing Adversarial Learning","abstract":"We study how, in generative adversarial networks, variance in the discriminator's output affects the generator's ability to learn the data distribution.

This seems like a rather crude approximation as the distribution of each “class” is likely to be multimodal. Can the authors comment on this? Could they extend their approach to use a mixture of multimodal distributions?\n\nThe paper mentions that fixing the means of the distribution can be “problematic during optimization as the discriminator’s goal is to maximize the difference between these two means.“. This relates to my previous comment where the distribution might not be unimodal. In this case, shifting the mean doesn’t seem to be a good solution and might just yield to oscillations between different modes. Can you please comment on this?\n\nMode collapse: Can you comment on the behavior of your approach w.r.t. to mode collapse?\n\nImplementation details: How is the mean of the two Gaussians initialized? \n\nRelation to instance noise and regularization techniques: Instance noise is a common trick being used to train GANs, see e.g. http://www.inference.vc/instance-noise-a-trick-for-stabilising-gan-training/\nThis also relates to some regularization techniques, e.g. Roth et al., 2017 that provides a regularizer that amounts to convolving the densities with white Gaussian noise. Can you please elaborate on the potential advantages of the proposed solution over these existing techniques?\n\nComparison to existing baselines: Given that the paper addresses the stability problem, I would expect some empirical comparison to at least one or two of the stability methods cited in the introduction, e.g. Gulrajani et al., 2017 or Roth et al., 2017.\n\nRelation to Kernel MMD: Can the authors elaborate on how their method relates to approaches that replace the discriminator with MMD nets. e.g.\n- Training generative neural networks via Maximum Mean Discrepancy optimization, Dziugaite et al\n- Generative models and model criticism via optimized maximum mean discrepancy, Sutherland et al\nMore explicitly, the variance in these methods can be controlled via the bandwidth of the kernel and I therefore wonder what would one use a simple mixture of Gaussians instead?\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Variance Regularizing Adversarial Learning","abstract":"We study how, in generative adversarial networks, variance in the discriminator's output affects the generator's ability to learn the data distribution.
