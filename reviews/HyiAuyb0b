The authors then experiment with a variety of TD and MC based deep learners to explore which methods are most robust to increases in difficulty along these dimensions. The key finding is that MC appears to be more robust than TD in a number of ways, and in particular the authors link this to domains with greater perceptual challenges. \n\nThis is a well motivated and explained paper, in which a research agenda is clearly defined and evaluated carefully with the results reflected on thoughtfully and with intuition. The authors discover some interesting characteristics of MC based Deep-RL which may influence future work in this area, and dig down a little to uncover the principles a little. The testing framework will be made public too, which adds to the value of this paper. I recommend the paper for acceptance and expect it will garner interest from the community.\n\nDetailed comments\n  • [p4, basic health gathering task] \"The goal is to survive and maintain as much health\nas possible by collecting health kits...The reward is +1 when the agent collects a health kit and 0 otherwise.\" The reward suggests that the goal is to collect as many health kits as possible, for which surviving and maintaining health are secondary.\n  • [p4, Delayed rewards] It might be interesting to have a delay sampled from a distribution with some known mean. Otherwise, the structure of the environment might support learning even when the reward delay would otherwise not.\n  • [p4, Sparse rewards] I am not sure it is fair to say that the general difficulty is kept fixed. Rather, the average achievable reward for an oracle (that knows whether health packs are) is fixed.\n  • [p6] \"Dosovitskiy & Koltun (2017) have not tested DFP on Atari games.\" Probably fairer/safer to say: did not report results on Atari games.\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Analyzing the Role of Temporal Differencing in Deep Reinforcement Learning","abstract":"Wide adoption of deep networks as function approximators in modern reinforcement learning (RL) is changing the research environment, both with regard to best practices and application domains.

Furthermore, the paper performs controlled experiments using the VizDoom environment to investigate the effect of a number of other environment characteristics, such as reward sparsity or perceptual complexity. The most interesting and surprising result is that finite-horizon Monte Carlo performs competitively in most tasks (with the exception of problems where terminal states play a big role (it does not do well at all on Pong!), and simple gridworld-type representations), and outperforms TD approaches in many of the more interesting settings. There is a really interesting experiment performed that suggests that this is the case due to finite-horizon MC having an easier time with learning perceptual representations. They also show, as a side result, that the reward decomposition in Dosvitskiy & Koltun (oral presentation at ICLR 2017) is not necessary for learning a good policy in VizDoom.\n\nOverall, I find the paper important for furthering the understanding of fundamental RL algorithms. However, my main concern is regarding a confounding factor that may have influenced the results: Q_MC uses a multi-headed model, trained on different horizon lengths, whereas the other models seem to have a single prediction head. May this helped Q_MC have better perceptual capabilities?\n\nA couple of other questions:\n- I couldn't find any mention of eligibility traces - why?\n- Why was the async RL framework used? It would be nice to have a discussion on whether this choice may have affected the results.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Analyzing the Role of Temporal Differencing in Deep Reinforcement Learning","abstract":"Wide adoption of deep networks as function approximators in modern reinforcement learning (RL) is changing the research environment, both with regard to best practices and application domains.

Such comparison has been carried out both in theory and practice for simple low dimensional environments with linear (and RKHS) value function approximation showing how TD methods can have much better sample complexity and overall performance compared to pure MC methods. This paper shows some results to the contrary when applying RL to complex perceptual observation space.\n\nThe main results include:\n(1) In a rollout update a mix of MC and TD update (i.e. a rollout of > 1 and < horizon) outperforms either extreme. This is inline with TD-lambda analysis in previous work.\n(2) Pure MC methods can outperform TD methods when the rewards becomes noisy.\n(3) TD methods can outperform pure MC methods when the return is mostly dominated by the reward in the terminal state.\n(4) MC methods tend to degrade less when the reward signal is delayed.\n(5) Somewhat surprising: MC methods seems to be on-par with TD methods when the reward is sparse and even longer than the rollout horizon.\n(6) MC methods can outperform TD methods with more complex and high dimensional perceptual inputs.\n\nThe authors conjecture that several of the above observations can be explained by the fact that the training target in MC methods is \"ground truth\" and do not rely on bootstrapping from the current estimates as is done in a TD rollout. They suggest that training on such signal can be beneficial when training deep models on complex perceptual input spaces.\n\nThe contributions of the paper are in parts surprising and overall interesting. I believe there are far more caveats in this analysis than what is suggested in the paper and the authors should avoid over-generalizing the results based on a few domains and the analysis of a small set of algorithms. Nonetheless I find the results interesting to the RL community and a starting point to further analysis of the MC methods (or adaptations of TD methods) that work better with image observation spaces. Publishing the code, as the authors mentioned, would certainly help with that. \n\nNotes:\n- I find the description of the Q_MC method presented in the paper very confusing and had to consult the reference to understand the details. Adding a couple of equations on this would improve the readability of the paper.\n\n- The first mention of partial observability can be moved to the introduction.\n\n- Adding results for m=3 to table 2 would bring further insight to the comparison.\n\n- The results for the perceptual complexity experiment seem contradictory and inconclusive. One would expect Q_MC to work well in Grid Map domain if the conjecture put forth by the authors was to hold universally.\n\n- In the study on reward sparsity, although a prediction horizon of 32 is less than the average steps needed to get to a rewarding state, a blind random walk might be enough to take the RL agent to a close-enough neighbourhood from which a greedy MC-based policy has a direct path to the goal. What is missing from this picture is when a blind walk cannot reach such a state, e.g. when a narrow corridor is present in the environment. Such a case cannot be resolved by a short horizon MC method. In other words, a sparse reward setting is only \"difficult\" if getting into a good neighbourhood requires long term planning and cannot be resolved by a (pseudo) blind random walk.\n\n- The extrapolation of the value function approximator can also contribute to why the limited horizon MC method can see beyond its horizon in a sparse reward setting. That is, even if there is no way to reach a reward state in 32 steps, an MC value function approximation with horizon 32 can extrapolate from similar looking observed states that have a short path to a rewarding state, enough to be better than a blind random walk. It would have been nice to experiment with increasing model complexity to study such effect.
