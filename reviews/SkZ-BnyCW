And then during joint training (section 3.2) you block direct gradient flow (disable the soft-binarization) and use VIMCO?\n\nYes. The direct gradient flow is blocked during joint training with VIMCO and Contrastive RWS.\n\n\n>>> I’m not convinced I follow the second part of the argument in 3.0: Training SBNs or DBNs with e.g. Gumbel-softmax based methods would allow gradients to flow in a very similar fashion. Doesn’t the “gradient flow” depend on the training method / gradient estimator (in your case soft-binarization) rather than this models structure?\n\nThe difference between our model and SBNs or DBNs is better illustrated in Figure 1. In DBN and SBN, every layer is stochastic and defines its own generative distribution p(z_i+1|z_i). There are N stochastic layers and thus N intermediate generative distributions. Correspondingly, there are N approximate inference distributions (as denoted by multiple upward arrows). The i-th inference layer is trained to approximate the posterior distribution of i-th generative layer. The learning signal for each layer depends locally on the input output states, but not on the gradient information that is propagated from deeper layers. In our model, the decoder and encoder are deterministic and continuous. They define one pair of p(x|z) and q(z|x) and there are no intermediate stochastic layers. Thus multiple layers in encoder/decoder are trained with gradients that flow freely within encoder/decoder.\n\nIf we train DBN or SBN with Gumbel-softmax based methods, the stochastic nodes in each layer are replaced with continuous approximations. In that case the gradient flow between layers is possible but not as freely as in our model because still in DBN or SBN, both the encoder and decoder would still be represented as stochastic layers. Since soft-binarization is only used during pretraining, our model does not contain any continuous relaxation during joint training (our encoder and decoder are continuous and deterministic), which is a major difference from continuous relaxation based methods.\n\n\n>>> From this perspective your model is directly comparable to Discrete VAEs, isn’t it? Where Discrete VAEs introduced a different reparam. based training method.\n\nBoth Discrete VAEs and our model utilize deep continuous encoder/decoder for stronger representation power. Discrete VAEs have a layer of continuous latent variables between bipartite Boltzmann machine prior and encoder/decoder. They project posterior and prior into a continuous space to make the \"autoencoder\" part of the loss be fully differentiable. \n\nIn our method, the \"autoencoder\" is fully differentiable during pretraining. In joint training, encoder and decoder only transmit stochastic states and thus block the gradient flow between them. Another difference in architecture is that Discrete VAEs use bipartite BM with both parts connected to the rest of the model while our models use 2 layer BM (RBM) with first layer connected to the latent space z and the second being fully hidden. In terms of density estimation, our model outperforms Discrete VAE on MNIST(79.58 vs. 81.01, as reported by [1]). We will clarify this point and add additional experimental results comparing our model to Discrete VAEs.\n\n\n>>> Have you tried alternative pretraining methods? E.g. using Gumbel-softmax based instead eqn. (3), or VIMCO trained factorial top layer SBN? Do we have any idea why joint training might be so hard?\n\nWe tried using soft-binarization with Gaussian noise but that introduces strong artifacts in generated images. Pretraining with Gumbel-softmax based methods is an interesting idea. In their original paper [2][3], the methods are tested on models with one or two layers. Thus it is hard to conclude immediately whether that will work as effectively on deep networks. But that will be worth exploring. Pretraining with SBN is more tricky. Note that it still does not solve the problem that deep generative models are very hard to train from scratch with REINFORCE style algorithms and discrete latent variables. Pretraining with factorial prior also adds stronger constrain on the approximate posterior compared with the RBM prior.\n\n\n>>> The title seems very broad - large parts of the paper propose and evaluate a pretraining procedure for a specific two layer DBM architecture.\n\nThank you for pointing this out, we will make the title be more focused. \n\n\n>>> I’m curious: What are typical log Z estimate for your models in table 1?\n\nBetween 265 and 270.\n\n\n[1] Discrete Variational Autoencoders\n[2] Categorical Reparameterization with Gumbel-Softmax\n[3] The Concrete Distribution: A Continuous Relaxation of Discrete Random Variables\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Learning Deep Generative Models With Discrete Latent Variables","abstract":"There have been numerous recent advancements on learning deep generative models with latent variables thanks to the reparameterization trick that allows to train deep directed models effectively.

To yield a good initialisation of the parameters of the RBM and the inference network a special pertaining procedure is introduced. The model produces competitive Likelihood results on MNIST and was further tested on CIFAR 10. \n\nClarity and quality: \n\n1. From the description of the pertaining procedure and the appendix B I got the impression that the inference network maps into [0,1] and not into {0,1}.  Does it mean, you are not really considering binary latent variables (making the RBM model the values in [0,1] by its probability p(z|h))? \n\n2. on page 2:\nRWS....\"derive a tighter lower bound\": Where does the \"tighter\" refer to? \n\n3. \"multivariate Bernoulli modeled by an RBM\": Note,  while in a multivariate Bernoulli the binary variables would be independent from each others, this is usually not the case for the visible variables of RBMs (only in the conditional distribution given the state of the hidden variables).\n\n4. The notation could be improved, e.g.:\n-x_data and x_sample are not explained\n- M is not defined in equation 5. \n\n5. \"this training method has been previously used to produce the best results on MNIST\" Note, that parallel tempering often leads to better results when training RBMs (see http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/desjardins10a/desjardins10a.pdf) . Furthermore, centred RBMs are also get better results than vanilla RBMs (see: http://jmlr.org/papers/v17/14-237.html).\n\nOriginality and significance:\nAs already mentioned in a comment on open-review the current version of the paper misses to mention one very related work: \"discrete variational auto encoders\". Also \"bidirectional Helmholtz machines\" could be mentioned as generative model with discrete latent variables.  The results for both should also be reported in Table 1 (discrete VAEs: 81,01, BiHMs: 84,3). \n\nFrom the motivation the advantages of the model did not become very clear to me. Main advantage seems to be the good likelihood result on MNIST (but likelihood does not improve compared to IWAE on CIFAR 10 for example). However, using an RBM as prior has the disadvantage that sampling from the generative model requires running a Markov chain now while having a solely directed generative model allows for fast sampling. \n\nExperiments show good likelihood results on MNIST. Best results are obtained when using a ResNet decoder. I wondered how much a standard VAE is improved by using such a powerful decoder. Reporting this, would allow to understand, how much is gained from using a RBM for learning the prior. \n\nMinor comments:\npage 1:\n\"debut of variational auto encoder (VAE) and reparametrization trick\" -> debut of variational auto encoders (VAE) and the reparametrization trick\",\npage 2:\n\"with respect to the parameter of  p(x,z)\" -> \"with respect to the parameters of  p(x,z)\"\n\"parameters in p\" -> \"parameters of p\" \n\"is multivariate Bernoulli\" ->  \"is a multivariate Bernoulli\"\n\"we compute them\" -> \"we compute it\" \npage 3:\n\"help find a good\" ->  \"help to find a good\"\npage 7:\n\"possible apply\" -> \"possible to apply\"","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Learning Deep Generative Models With Discrete Latent Variables","abstract":"There have been numerous recent advancements on learning deep generative models with latent variables thanks to the reparameterization trick that allows to train deep directed models effectively.
