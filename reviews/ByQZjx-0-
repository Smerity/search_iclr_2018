The authors propose a new approach they call Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS), whose key insight is parameter sharing. In NAS, the practitioners have to retrain for every new architecture in the search process, but in ENAS this problem is avoided by sharing parameters and using discrete masks. In both approaches, reinforcement learning is used to  learn a policy that maximizes the expected reward of some validation set metric. Since we can encode a neural network as a sequence, the policy can be parameterized as an RNN where every step of the sequence corresponds to an architectural choice. In their experiments, ENAS achieves test set metrics that are almost as good as NAS, yet require significantly less computational resources and time.\n\nThe authors present two ENAS models: one for CNNs, and another for RNNs. Initially it seems like the controller can choose any of B operations in a fixed number of layers along with choosing to turn on or off ay pair of skip connections. However, in practice we see that the search space for modeling both skip connections and choosing convolutional sizes is too large, so the authors use only one restriction to reduce the size of the state space. This is a limitation, as the model space is not as flexible as one would desire in a discovery task. Moreover, their best results (and those they choose to report in the abstract) are due to fixing 4 parallel branches at every layer combined with a 1 x 1 convolution, and using ENAS to learn the skip connections. Thus, they are essentially learning the skip connections while using a human-selected model. \n\nENAS for RNNs is similar: while NAS searches for a new architecture, the authors use a recurrent highway network for each cell and use ENAS to find the skip connections. Thus, it seems like the term Efficient Neural Architecture Search promises too much since in both tasks they are essentially only using the controller to find skip connections. Although finding an appropriate architecture for skip connections is an important task, finding an efficient method to structure RNN cells seems like a significantly more important goal.\n\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and it brings up an important idea: that parameter sharing is important for discovery tasks so we can avoid re-training for every new architecture in the search process. Moreover, using binary masks to control network path (essentially corresponding to training different models) is a neat idea. It is also impressive how much faster their model performs on tasks without sacrificing much performance. The main limitation is that the best architectures as currently described are less about discovery and more about human input -- finding a more efficient search path would be an important next step.","confidence":"2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Faster Discovery of Neural Architectures by Searching for Paths in a Large Model","abstract":"We propose an approach for automatic model designing, which is significantly faster and less expensive than previous methods.

The method is relatively efficient, since it searches in a space of similar architectures, and uses weights sharing between the tested models to avoid optimization of each model from scratch. Results are presented for image classification on Cifar 10 and for language modeling.\n\nPage 3: “for each channel, we only predict C/S binary masks”   -> this seems to be a mistake. Probably “for each operation, we only predict C/S binary masks” is the right wording\nPage 4: Stabilizing Stochastic Skip Connections: it seems that the suggested configuration does not enable an identity path, which was found very beneficial in (He. et al., 2016). Identity path does not exist since layers are concatenated and go through 1*1 conv, which does not enable plain identity unless learned by the 1*1 conv.\nPage 5: \n-\tThe last paragraph in section 4.2 is not clear to me. What does a compilation failure mean in this context and why does it occur? And: if each layer is connected to all its previous layers by skip connections, what remains to be learned w.r.t the model structure? Isn’t the pattern of skip connection the thing we would like to learn?\n-\tSome  details of the policy LSTM network are also not clear to me:\no\tHow is the integer mask (output of the B channel steps) encoded? Using 1-hot encoding over 2^{C/S} output neurons? Or maybe C/S output neurons, used for sampling the C/S bits of the mask? this should be reported in some detail.\no\tHow is the mask converted to an input embedding for the next step? Is it by linear multiplication with a matrix? Something more complicated? And are there different matrices used/trained for each mask embedding (one for 1*1 conv, one for 3*3 conv, etc..)?\no\tWhat is the motivation for using equation 5 for the sampling of skip connection flags? What is the motivation for averaging the winning anchors as the average embedding for the next stage (to let it ‘know’ who is connected to the previous?). Is anchor j also added to the average?\no\tHow is equation 5 normalized? That is: the probability is stated to be proportional to an exponent of an inner product, but it is not clear what the constant is and how sampling is done.\n\nPage 6: \n-\t  Section 4.4: what is the fixed policy used for generating models in the stage of training the shared W parameters? (this is answered at page 7\nExperiments:\n-\tThe accuracy figures obtained are impressive, but I’m not convinced the ENAS learning is the important ingredient in obtaining them (rather than a very good baseline)\n-\tSpecifically, in the Cifar -10 example it does not seem that the networks chooses the number of maps in a way which is diverse or different from layer to layer. Therefore we do not have any evidence that the LSTM controller has learnt any interesting rule regarding block type, or relation between block type width and layer index. All we see is that the model does not chose too many maps, thus avoid significant overfit. The relevant baseline here is a model with 64 or 96 maps on each block, each layer.Such a model is likely to do as well as the ENAS model, and can be obtained easily with slight parameter tuning of a single parameter.\n-\t Similarly, I’m not convinced the  skip connection pattern found for Cifar-10 is superior to standard denseNet or Resnet pattern. The found configuration was not compared to these baselines. So again we do not have evidence showing the merit of keeping and tuning many parameters with the RINFORCE\n-\tThe experiments with Penn Treebank are described with too less details: for example, what exactly is the task considered (in terms on input-output mapping), what is the dataset size, etc..\n-\tAlso, for the Penn treebank experiments no baseline is given, so it is not possible to understand if the structure learning here is beneficial. Comparison of the results to an architecture with all skip connections, and with a single skip connection per layer is required to estimate if useful structure is being learnt.\n\nOverall:\n-\tPro: the method gives high accuracy results \n-\tCons: \no\tIt is not clear if the ENAS search is responsible to the results, or just the strong baseline. The advantage of ENAS over plain hyper parameter choosing was not sufficiently established.\no\tThe controller was not presented in a clear enough manner. Many of its details stay obscure.\no\tThe method does not seem to be general. It seems to be limited to choosing a specific set of parameters in very specific scenario (scenario which enable parameter sharing between model. The conditions for this to happen seems to be rather strict, and where not elaborated).\n","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Faster Discovery of Neural Architectures by Searching for Paths in a Large Model","abstract":"We propose an approach for automatic model designing, which is significantly faster and less expensive than previous methods.

On the Penn Treebank dataset, ENAS also discovers a novel architecture, which achieves the test perplexity of 64.6 compared to 62.4 by standard NAS.","pdf":"/pdf/faf198766f34fb01ae8a4471d71aa526e8e92291.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|faster_discovery_of_neural_architectures_by_searching_for_paths_in_a_large_model","_bibtex":"@article{\n  anonymous2018faster,\n  title={Faster Discovery of Neural Architectures by Searching for Paths in a Large Model},\n  author={Anonymous},\n  journal={International Conference on Learning Representations},\n  year={2018},\n  url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByQZjx-0-}\n}","keywords":["neural architecture search"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper619/Authors"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":8,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"}],"limit":2000,"offset":0}
