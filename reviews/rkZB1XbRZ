The introduction was substantially revised and now includes Figure 1 that illustrates our improvements over the original PATE work. Table 1 includes updated parameters that dominate previously reported state-of-the-art utility and privacy on standard datasets. Figures 4 and 5 illustrate savings to privacy costs due to selective answers. The Appendix was expanded to include discussion of smooth sensitivity.\n\nThe reviewer correctly notes that the privacy guarantees depend on sensitive information and this should be accounted for. In Section 2.4, we briefly mention that we handle this using the smooth sensitivity framework (as in the original PATE paper) and in our revised draft of the submission, we provide a detailed overview of our smooth sensitivity analysis in Appendix C.3. \n\nThe reported numbers in the rest of our work are without this smooth sensitivity noise added to the privacy cost, because we find that the smooth sensitivity is small enough that adding noise to sanitize the privacy cost itself does not have a significant impact on the value of the privacy cost for the cases reported. We will release the code to calculate the smooth sensitivity along with the next version of our paper.\n\nWhile the work of Rogers et al. deals with related issues, it operates in a different setting. There, the privacy cost is input-independent, but is a function of the output and of when the mechanism is stopped. While it would be useful to have an odometer-like scheme where we can run the mechanism until a certain privacy budget is consumed, we find that running for a fixed number of steps and estimating the privacy spent using the smooth sensitivity framework largely suffices for the current work.\n\nThe sparse-vector technique, the works on private multiplicative weight (PMW) and the median mechanism are related to our work and we have added more discussion on them in the related work section (Appendix B). Both PMW and the Median mechanism can be thought of as algorithms that first privately select a small number of queries to answer using the database, and then answer them using a differentially private mechanism. In PMW and Median, the selection is drastic and prunes out all but a tiny fraction of queries, and the sparse vector technique allows one to analyze this step. In our case, the selection ends up choosing (or discarding) a non-trivial fraction of the queries (between 30% and 90% for parameter settings reported in the submission). We explored using the sparse vector technique for this part of the analysis and it did not lead to any reduction in the privacy cost: while we pay only for the selected queries, the additional constant factors in the sparse vector technique wash out this benefit.\n\nFor the second part of actually answering the queries, PMW and Median do a traditional data-independent privacy analysis. In our setting, using a data-independent privacy analysis in the second step would require a lot more noise than the learning process can tolerate, and we benefit greatly from using a data-dependent privacy analysis. The selection not only cuts down the number of queries that are answered, but more importantly, selects for queries that are cheap to answer from the privacy point of view. In summary: In PMW, the goal of the selection is to reduce number of answered queries from Q to log Q, and one does a data-independent privacy analysis for answering those. In our case the goal of filtering is to select a constant fraction of queries that will have a clear majority, so that the data-dependent privacy cost is small."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Scalable Private Learning with PATE","abstract":"The rapid adoption of machine learning has increased concerns about the privacy\nimplications of machine learning models trained on sensitive data, such as medical\nrecords or other personal information.

Below are answers for each of the three points included in your feedback.\n\n1. You are right that the variance of the distribution plays a fundamental role in the utility-privacy tradeoff. Roughly speaking, larger noise variances typically yield stronger privacy guarantees but reduce the utility of the aggregated label. We updated Figure 2 to illustrate this relationship, separating the effects of the shape of the noise distribution and the number of teachers. \n\nThe left chart of Figure 2 plots the utility-privacy tradeoff for the Laplace (prior work) and the Gaussian (ours) aggregation mechanisms. The measurement points are labelled with the standard deviation of the noise (sigma) which ranges from 5 to 200. As intuition suggests, the accuracy decreases with the variance of the noise. The privacy cost cannot be measured directly (as it involves considering all possible counterfactuals). Rather, it is computed according to Theorem 2, which is a significant technical contribution of this paper. For some ranges of parameters, privacy costs are a non-monotone function of sigma, which is discussed in the end of Section 4.2.\n\n2. We acknowledge the reviewer's comment about giving an intuitive overview of how we achieve differential privacy. The intuitive privacy guarantee of PATE remains the same as that presented in the original PATE paper by Papernot et al.: Partitioning training data ensures that the presence or absence of a single training data point affects at most one teacher’s vote. By adding noise to the teacher votes, we control the impact of a single teacher vote in the final outcome of the aggregation mechanism, resulting from the plurality of votes in the teacher ensemble. In fact, precisely bounding this impact, in a tighter way, requires the use of data-dependent analysis. The large variability between queries’ privacy costs motivates the Confident Aggregator, which minimizes total privacy budget by being selective in the student queries it chooses to answer.\n\nTo see why the Confident Aggregator is useful, here are a couple of illustrations of cheap and expensive queries in terms of their privacy cost. Consider our ensembles of 5000 teachers with the following votes across classes (4900, 100, 0, … 0). You can see that there is an overwhelming consensus and after adding noise, the chance that Class 1 is output by the ensemble is still very high. The resulting privacy cost (at Gaussian noise with stdev 100) is 3.6e-249.\n\nHowever, if there’s poor consensus amongst the teachers, with votes, say, (2500, 2400, 100, … ) i.e., the ensemble is rather confused between Classes 1 and 2, then the resulting privacy cost is 0.0025. It is also easy to see intuitively for our choices of thresholds, why the first example would almost surely be selected but the second example would likely not pass the threshold check. \n\nUnfortunately due to space constraints, we could not provide detailed intuition on these aspects. Some of them follow from the original PATE paper, and we try to give some insight into how the Confident Aggregator works through the experiment in Section 4.4.2. In particular, Figure 6 shows how queries along the lines of the second example above are eliminated.\n\n3. You are correct: private information may be revealed when the teacher ensemble does not answer because it indicates that teachers do not agree on the prediction. This is why our selective aggregation mechanisms choose in a privacy-preserving way queries that will be answered. This consideration motivates the design of the condition found at line 1 of Algorithm 1 and line 2 of Algorithm 2 in the submission draft, which both add Gaussian noise with variance $\\sigma_1^2$ before applying the maximum operator and comparing the result to the predefined threshold T. This ensures that the teacher consensus is checked in differentially private manner. In fact, _most_ of the total privacy budget is committed to selecting the set of queries whose answers are going to be revealed. We thank you for bringing this to our attention and updated the introduction of Section 3, as well as the captions of Algorithms 1 and 2 to emphasize this important consideration."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Scalable Private Learning with PATE","abstract":"The rapid adoption of machine learning has increased concerns about the privacy\nimplications of machine learning models trained on sensitive data, such as medical\nrecords or other personal information.

The dataset is partitioned and multiple learning algorithms produce so-called teacher classifiers. The labels produced by the teachers are aggregated in a differentially private manner and the aggregated labels are then used to train a student classifier, which forms the final output. The novelty of this work is a refined aggregation process, which is improved in three ways:\na) Gaussian instead of Laplace noise is used to achieve differential privacy.\nb) Queries to the aggregator are \"filtered\" so that the limited privacy budget is only expended on queries where the teachers are confident and the student is uncertain or wrong.\nc) A data-dependent privacy analysis is used to attain sharper bounds on the privacy loss with each query.\n\nI think this is a nice modular framework form private learning, with significant refinements relative to previous work that make the algorithm more practical. On this basis, I think the paper should be accepted. However, I think some clarification is needed with regard to item c above:\n\nTheorem 2 gives a data-dependent privacy guarantee. That is, if there is one label backed by a clear majority of teachers, then the privacy loss (as measured by Renyi divergence) is low. This data-dependent privacy guarantee is likely to be much tighter than the data-independent guarantee.\nHowever, since the privacy guarantee now depends on the data, it is itself sensitive information. How is this issue resolved? If the final privacy guarantee is data-dependent, then this is very different to the way differential privacy is usually applied. This would resemble the \"privacy odometer\" setting of Rogers-Roth-Ullman-Vadhan [ https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08294 ]. \nAnother way to resolve this would be to have an output-dependent privacy guarantee. That is, the privacy guarantee would depend only on public information, rather than the private data. The widely-used \"sparse vector\" technique [ http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf#page=59 ] does this.\nIn any case, this is an important issue that needs to be clarified, as it is not clear to me how this is resolved.\n\nThe algorithm in this work is similar to the so-called median mechanism [ https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/onlineprivacy.pdf ] and private multiplicative weights [ http://mrtz.org/papers/HR10mult.pdf ]. These works also involve a \"student\" being trained using sensitive data with queries being answered in a differentially private manner. And, in particular, these works also filter out uninformative queries using the sparse vector technique.

Our\nevaluation show our mechanisms to improve on the original PATE on all measures,\nand scale to larger tasks with both high utility and very strong privacy (ε ≈ 1.0).","pdf":"/pdf/e6393dddcab0257d27eaf2651c68cd53f5a45ea3.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|scalable_private_learning_with_pate","_bibtex":"@article{\n  anonymous2018scalable,\n  title={Scalable Private Learning with PATE},\n  author={Anonymous},\n  journal={International Conference on Learning Representations},\n  year={2018},\n  url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkZB1XbRZ}\n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1088/Authors"],"keywords":["privacy","differential privacy","machine learning","deep learning"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":6,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"}],"limit":2000,"offset":0}
