The method relates closely to prior work on action-dependent baselines, but explores in particular on-policy fitting and a few other design choices that empirically improve the performance. \n\nA criticism of the paper is that it does not require Stein’s identity/control functionals literature to derive Eq. 8, since it can be derived similarly to linear control variate and it has also previously been discussed in IPG [Gu et. al., 2017] as reparameterizable control variate. The derivation through Stein’s identity does not seem to provide additional insights/algorithm designs beyond direct derivation through reparameterization trick.\n\nThe empirical results appear promising, and in particular in comparison with Q-Prop, which fits Q-function using off-policy TD learning. However, the discussion on the causes of the difference should be elaborated much more, as it appears there are substantial differences besides on-policy/off-policy fitting of the Q, such as:\n\n-FitLinear fits linear Q (through parameterization based on linearization of Q) using on-policy learning, rather than fitting nonlinear Q and then at application time linearize around the mean action. A closer comparison would be to use same locally linear Q function for off-policy learning in Q-Prop.\n\n-The use of on-policy fitted value baseline within Q-function parameterization during on-policy fitting is nice. Similar comparison should be done with off-policy fitting in Q-Prop.\n\nI wonder if on-policy fitting of Q can be elaborated more. Specifically, on-policy fitting of V seems to require a few design details to have best performance [GAE, Schulman et. al., 2016]: fitting on previous batch instead of current batch to avoid overfitting  (this is expected for your method as well, since by fitting to current batch the control variate then depends nontrivially on samples that are being applied), and possible use of trust-region regularization to prevent V from changing too much across iterations. \n\nThe paper presents promising results with direct on-policy fitting of action-dependent baseline, which is promising since it does not require long training iterations as in off-policy fitting in Q-Prop. As discussed above, it is encouraged to elaborate other potential causes that led to performance differences. The experimental results are presented well for a range of Mujoco tasks. \n\nPros:\n\n-Simple, effective method that appears readily available to be incorporated to any on-policy PG methods without significantly increase in computational time\n\n-Good empirical evaluation\n\nCons:\n\n-The name Stein control variate seems misleading since the algorithm/method does not rely on derivation through Stein’s identity etc. and does not inherit novel insights due to this derivation.\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"SAMPLE-EFFICIENT POLICY OPTIMIZATION WITH STEIN CONTROL VARIATE","abstract":"Policy gradient methods have achieved remarkable successes in solving challenging reinforcement learning problems.

Equation (8) from your paper is exactly equivalent to Equation (6) (LAX estimator) of the paper, specifically by setting:\npi(a|theta) = p(b|theta)\nQ(s,a) = f(b)\nphi(s,a) = c_phi(b)\nf(s, eps|theta) = T(eps, theta)\nSimilar to your remark in Equation (13) the other authors just below their Equation (6) mention that taking the \"control\" function equal the original one (if that is differentiable) we recover the path gradient. Additionally, they also suggest optimizing the \"control\" function by minimizing the variance.\n\nRegarding, equation (18) and the Gaussian policy indeed it is an interesting observation that we can apply this a second time and get a potentially lower variance estimator. This in fact I think is a more general result that if the derivatives depend on epsilon you can reapply the procedure, but don't cite me on that. Potentially, investigating/generalizing that might be interesting.

It is highly relevant. Their estimator in the RL setting (their Eq 11) is mathematically equivalent to ours.

By combining with PPO and TRPO, we obtain significant improvement on challenging RL tasks such as Humanoid-v1 and HumanoidStandup-v1. We also proposed and tested different architectures and optimization methods for the control variates, providing guidance on what may work best in practice.
