We have adapted the manuscript to make the contributions and scope clearer.\n\nAlgorithms that allow the generation of small molecules (small graphs) that satisfy given desirable properties are rapidly evolving for medicine, materials and agriculture.  This is currently an area of intense investigation, theoretically as well as practically, as highlighted by several ICLR submissions on molecule/graph generation this year, which all employ different and inconsistent benchmarks and training sets. Currently, it is not possible to compare these results.\n\nWith this paper, we unify the problem space of small molecule generation and thoroughly investigate various approaches (including algorithms which have yet to be explored in this domain, e.g. PPO), and include evaluations of our new benchmarks on pre-existing work.\n\nOur results surpass state-of-the-art results previously reported on a few of the sub-domains, establishing new baselines, and come to the perhaps surprising result that the relatively simple hill-climbing MLE method achieves results on par with the some of the most advanced recently-developed RL algorithms such as PPO.\n\n\nSpecific Comments:\n\n* Regarding lack of focus: we have reorganized the paper to improve the clarity of the work.\n  \n* Regarding purpose: We hope the above responses address your concern of this being a survey work. We believe this work introduces new benchmarks, evaluates pre-existing algorithms, demonstrates novel pairings of algorithm and domain, and establishes a new state-of-the art as well as a few surprising additional insights (hill-climbing MLE supremacy, temperature ineffectiveness).\n\n* Regarding preprocessing steps: the steps taken in this work are standard and in line with the field of computational chemistry [1,2]. This includes the removal of Sodium, Calcium and Potassium, and other counterions.\n\n* Regarding clarity of RL vs. train/test set: for algorithms that rely on pretraining to help navigate the extremely large space of small molecule generation (~10^60), it is important that the algorithms have not been exposed to a correct solution in the training set, hence the train-test split.  As an additional benefit, a train/test split permits the benchmarks to be used with rule-based GOFAI systems, supervised algorithms as well as RL.\n\n* Regarding molecular property prediction: indeed, this is an important sub-field of computational chemistry and is explored under the family of QSAR models [3, 4].  However, that is out-of-scope of this paper, as it attempts to address a different concern.\n\n* Regarding data: the table is a bit overwhelming already, so we chose not to exhaustively show all results for all models and instead focus on representative key models.  Due to time and computational constraints, we had not run more than three initializations, but can do so for the revision.\n\n\nWe hope this addresses your concerns.\n\n[1] Glaab, Enrico. \"Building a virtual ligand screening pipeline using free software: a survey.\" Briefings in bioinformatics 17.2 (2015): 352-366.\n[2] Lionta, Evanthia, et al. \"Structure-based virtual screening for drug discovery: principles, applications and recent advances.\" Current topics in medicinal chemistry 14.16 (2014): 1923-1938.\n[3] Tropsha, Alexander. \"Best practices for QSAR model development, validation, and exploitation.\" Molecular informatics 29.6‚Äê7 (2010): 476-488.\n[4] Tropsha, Alexander, and Alexander Golbraikh. \"Predictive QSAR modeling workflow, model applicability domains, and virtual screening.\" Current pharmaceutical design 13.34 (2007): 3494-3504.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Exploring Deep Recurrent Models with Reinforcement Learning for Molecule Design","abstract":"The design of small molecules with bespoke properties is of central importance to drug discovery.

The main contributions of the paper are 19 molecular design benchmarks (with chembl-23 dataset), including two molecular design evaluation criterias and comparison of some deep models using these benchmarks.

Several existing models are discussed to some length, while the benchmarks are introduced quite shortly. The dataset is not very clearly defined: it seems that there are 1.2 million training instance, does this apply for all benchmarks? The paper's title also does not seem to fit: this feels like a survey paper, which is not reflected in the title. Biologically lots of important atoms are excluded from the dataset, for instance natrium, calcium and kalium. I don't see any reason to exlude these. What does \"biological activities on 11538 targets\" mean? \n\nThe paper discussed molecular generation and reinforcement learning, but it is somewhat unclear how it relates to the proposed dataset since a standard training/test setting is used. Are the test molecules somehow generated in a directed or undirected fashion? Shouldn't there also be experiments on comparing ways to generate suitable molecules, and how well they match the proposed criterion? There should be benchmarks for predicting molecular properties (standard regression), and for generating molecules with certain properties. Currently it's unclear which type of problems are solved here.\n\nTable 1 lists 5 models, while fig 3 contains 7, why the discrepancy?

However significant challenges yet remain for computational methods, despite recent advances such as deep recurrent networks and reinforcement learning strategies for sequence generation, and it can be difficult to compare results across different works.
