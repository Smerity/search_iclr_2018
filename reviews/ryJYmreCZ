However, it seems that in equation 4, the authors assume that the noise distribution is a unigram model over words. However, one is allowed to use any noise distribution in NCE, and convergence should be quicker with those distributions that are close to the true distribution. Does the argument hold for general noise distributions ? With this assumption, they can borrow easily from Goldberg and Levy, 2014 for the proof. \nIn experiments, they find that while NCE does result in self-normalization, it is inversely correlated with perplexity which is a bit surprising. The paper is interesting but lacks strong empirical results. It could be stronger if they could exploit some of their findings to improve language modeling over a strong baseline.

This kind\nof approaches, such as NCE (Noise Contrastive Estimation) is very\npromising and important to provide efficient and large vocabulary\nlanguage models.\n\nBy interpreting the NCE in terms of matrix factorization allows the\nauthors to better explain this learning criterion and more\nspecifically the self-normalizing mechanism.\n\nHowever, the first (theoritical) contribution is to make the link\nbetween matrix decomposition and sampling based objective. This was\nalready shown for negative sampling in the paper of Melamud et al. in\nEMNLP 2017. Therefore, nothing new here, the difference is slight.\nMoreover, this paper is only cited in the experimental part, while the\ncontribution should be far more emphasized by the authors.\n\nThe second part makes the link with the self-normalization. This is\nnot really surprising. This was already explained in the same way in\npapers from Pihlaja,Gutmann and Hyvarinen published in 2010/12.

The idea is to perform nonlinear logistic regression to discriminate between the observed data and some artificially generated noise, using the model log-density function in the regression nonlinearity.  We show that this leads to a consistent (convergent) estimator of the parameters, and analyze the asymptotic variance.  In particular, the method is shown to directly work for unnormalized models, i.e. models where the density function does not integrate to one. The normalization constant can be estimated just like any other parameter. For a tractable ICA model, we compare the method with other estimation methods that can be used to learn unnormalized models, including score matching, contrastive divergence, and maximum-likelihood where the normalization constant is estimated with importance sampling. Simulations show that noise-contrastive estimation offers the best trade-off between computational and statistical efficiency. The method is then applied to the modeling of natural images: We show that the method can successfully estimate a large-scale two-layer model and a Markov random field.}\n}\n\n\n\n@inbook{Pihlaja10Unnorm,\n\tAuthor = {M.
