Was the setup used ... exactly the same as the one used by Dahl et al.?\n\nOur response:\nOur generation models had not finished training on ImageNet. We now have significantly better perplexities (3.78 bits/dim, 3.77 with checkpoint averaging) than the row PixelRNN (3.86 bits/dim) and the Gated PixelCNN (3.83 bits/dim, previous SOTA) models. Gated PixelCNN improved over the previous SOTA by only 0.03, our improvement is twice as large. \n\nReviewer:\n… human evaluations can be extremely sensitive to changes in the setup … Please include error bars.\n\n\nOur response:\nWe included error bars which show that the variance is small, and the subjects (50 per image) are fairly clear on their preferences of images. We ensured that we use the exact same evaluation setup, down to the interface presented to the subjects.\n\nReviewer:\nThe CelebA super-resolution task … to fix this, the human observers should also receive the low-resolution image\n\nOur response:\nWe agree, yet followed Dahl, et al.’s procedure exactly for comparability. While the shortcoming of the evaluation does present a potential loophole, allowing the model to generate images that do not downsample back to the input image, our model does not exploit this. It does generate images that, when downsampled, yield images very close to the low resolution input.\n\nTo demonstrate this, we compared the pixel/channel-level L2^2-distance between the low-resolution input image and the downsampled output image. Across 300 images from the CelebA test set, the average per-pixel, per-channel distance in normalized intensities between the input and the downsampled output images is 0.0106. The average distance between each of the low-resolution input images and 100 other downsampled images from the CelebA test set each is 0.1188. Given these are all cropped images of faces, we believe the difference to be significant. To underline this, we chose those two input images for which the downsampled version of the output image generated by our model is most different from the input image according to this metric and made them available here. Even here the downsampled output of our model is very similar to the original input.\n\nDue to shortage of space, we kindly request the reviewer to refer to the links in our response to Anonymous Reviewer 2.\n\nThe respective distances are 0.0344 and 0.03119 (between the input and model output images, each downsampled). We hope this shows that our model generates plausible images adhering to the intended constraint: that when downsampled they are very similar to the original low-resolution input image.\n\nThe input images constitute rich conditioning information such as hair and skin color, object position and pose, background color, etc. We believe there is real demand for models improving perceptual detail in images without a specific, expected output.\n\n\nReviewer:\n...Could gated convolutions not also be considered a form of self-attention?\n\n\n\nOur response:\nThere is some similarity to the multiplicative effects in self attention and gated CNNs, but there are also clear differences. Both use gating to scale the activations in multiplicative terms, which can prevent gradients from ‘blowing up’.\n\nIn self-attention, we have two sources of multiplicative interactions: 1) softmax-gated query key inner products which give us multiplicative effects between query and key representations, and 2) multiplicative interaction of the softmax weights with all values at each position, once per head. In self-attention, we first filter (softmax gating), and then aggregate (linear combination of values) per head, while gated convolutions first aggregate (applying the kernel) and then filter (gating). Because of the large receptive field of local self-attention, we achieve multiplicative interactions between positions that are far apart, which can be computationally expensive for convolutions. Both gating mechanisms are complementary and can be used together, e.g. the gating from gated PixelCNN could replace our position-wise FFNN layers.\n\nReviewer:\nThe presentation/text could use some work. ….\n\nOur response:\nWe hoped to fit the submission within 9 pages, focusing on novel content at the expense of being self-contained. However, Equation 1 describes the computation applied to each position in every layer completely - the only exception being multiple heads. If accepted, we will repeat more unchanged details of the model.\n\nReviewer:\nThe authors write “we believe our cherry-picked images for various classes to be of higher perceptual quality”.\n\nOur response:\nWe have revised our language and now write “we believe our curated images for various classes to be of reasonable perceptual quality”, without comparing the perceptual quality to other work.\n\nWe removed the statement on “pretty cool” images from the abstract.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Image Transformer","abstract":"Image generation has been successfully cast as an autoregressive sequence generation\nor transformation problem.

We now have even better perplexities (3.78 bits/dim, 3.77 with checkpoint averaging) than the row PixelRNN (3.86 bits/dim) and the Gated PixelCNN (3.83 bits/dim, previous state of the art) models.\nGated PixelCNN improved over the previous state of the art by only 0.03, while our improvement is twice as large. Over the entire image of 3072 dimensions, the improvement in bits is quite significant.\n\nReviewer:\nThe motivation part is missing. ... Why not just a deeper network with more parameters? Throughout the paper I cannot find a clear answer for this. Based on this I couldn't see a clear contribution. \n\nOur response:\nWe agree with the reviewer that our motivation might not have been described well in the original submission. We added a more thorough motivation to the introduction of the paper, which we repeat here in summary for your convenience. \n\nOne disadvantage of CNNs compared to RNNs is their typically fairly limited receptive field. This can adversely affect their ability to model long-range phenomena common in images, such as symmetry and occlusion, especially with a small number of layers. Growing the receptive field, like deepening the network, however, comes at a significant cost in number of parameters and hence computation and can make training such models more challenging.\n\nWith the Image Transformer, we aim to find a better balance in the trade-off between the virtually unlimited receptive field of the necessarily sequential PixelRNN and the limited receptive field of the much more\nparallelizable PixelCNN and its various extensions.\n\nWe propose eschewing recurrent and convolutional networks in favor of a model based entirely on a locally restricted form of multi-head self-attention that could also be interpreted as a sparsely parameterized form of convolution,  allowing  for  significantly  larger  receptive  fields  than  CNNs  at  the  same  number  of parameters.\n\nWe furthermore added additional experiments indicating that indeed, increasing the size of the receptive field significantly improves the performance of our model, allowing it to (now significantly, see below) outperform the state of the art. These show that increasing the perceptive field from 16 to 256 positions, for instance, improves perplexity on CIFAR-10 Test from 3.47 to 2.99.\n\n\nReviewer:\nThe paper is difficult to keep the track given the current flow. Each subsection of section 3 starts with technique details without explaining why we do this. Some sentences like \"look pretty cool\" is not academic. \n\nOur response:\nWe removed that sentence from the abstract, added additional material on the motivation, as summarized above, and tried to improve the overall flow in a flew places.\n\n\nReviewer:\nThe experiments lack comparisons except the human evaluation,  … Does it compare all the competing algorithms against the same sub-samples of the GT data? ...\n\nOur response:\nWe follow the same evaluation procedure as Dahl, et al.’s paper but do not use the same exact sub-samples as we could not recover them. For each model, we use 50 randomly selected dev images where each image is rated by 50 workers. We use a different set of workers for each model. Also, our latest results on imagenet unconditional generation perplexities show a significant improvement in log likelihoods over the previous state-of-the-art. \n\nReviewer:\nApart from this metric, I would like to see qualitative comparison between competing algorithms in the paper as well. Also other approaches e.g. SRGAN could be compared.\n\nOur Response:\nIt would be very difficult to conduct a proper qualitative evaluation because we are missing representative samples from the various algorithms. We hope that our human evaluation numbers capture some qualitative differences between our model and pixel cnn.\n\nReviewer:\nI am also interested about the author's claim that the implementation error that influences the log-likelihood. Has this been fixed after the deadline?\n\nOur response:\nWe have indeed fixed the bug. The resulting images are now free of artifacts and the log-likelihood did improve. That said, we are still in the middle of conducting a final, apples-to-apples comparison between 1D and 2D self attention on various super-resolution tasks and will include the results of this in the final paper.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Image Transformer","abstract":"Image generation has been successfully cast as an autoregressive sequence generation\nor transformation problem.

The latter is inspired by the work of [Vaswani et al., 2016], which was proposed for sequences and is extended to 2D images in this work. The authors apply their model to super-resolution of face images, as well as image completion (aka inpainting) and generation, both unconditioned or conditioned on one of a small number of image classes from the CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets. The authors evaluate their method in terms of visual quality of their generated images via an Amazon Mechanical Turk survey and quantitatively by reporting slightly improved log-likelihoods. \n\nWhile the paper is well written, the motivation for combining self-attention and autoregressive models remains unclear unfortunately, even more though as the reported quantitative improvement in terms of log-likelihood are only marginal. The technical exposition is at times difficult to follow with some design decisions of the network layout being quite ad hoc and not well motivated. Expressing the involved operations in mathematical terms would help comprehend some of the technical details and add to the reproducibility of the proposed model. \n\nAnother concern is the experimental evaluation. While the reported log-likelihoods are only marginally better, the authors report a significant boost in how often humans are fooled by the generated images. While the image generation is conditioned on the low-resolution input, the workers in the Amazon Mechanical Turk study get to see the high-resolution images only. Of course, a human observer would pick the one image out of the two shown images which is more realistic although it might have nothing to do with the input image, which seems wrong. Instead, the workers should see the low-res input image and then have to decide which high-res image seems a better match or more likely.\n\nOverall, the presented work looks quite promising and an interesting line of research. However, in its present form the manuscript doesn't seem quite ready for publication yet. Though, I would strongly encourage the authors to make the exposition more self-contained and accessible, in particular through rigorous mathematical terms, which would help comprehend the involved operations and help understand the proposed mechanism.\n\nAdditional comments:\n- Abstract: \"we also believe to look pretty cool\".

The proposed model is evaluated in terms of visual appearance of samples and log-likelihoods. The authors find a small improvement in terms of log-likelihood over PixelCNNs and that super-resolved CelebA images are able to fool human observers significantly more often than PixelRNN based super-resolution (Dahl et al., 2017).\n\nReview\n\nAutoregressive models are of large interest to the ICLR community and exploring new architectures is a valuable contribution. Using self-attention in autoregressive models is an intriguing idea. It is a little bit disappointing that the added model complexity only yields a small improvement compared to the more straight-forward modifications of the PixelCNN++. I think the paper would benefit from a little bit more work, but I am open to adjusting my score based on feedback.\n\nI find it somewhat surprising that the proposed model is only slightly better in terms of log-likelihood than a PixelRNN, but much better in terms of human evaluation – given that both models were optimized for log-likelihood. Was the setup used with Mechanical Turk exactly the same as the one used by Dahl et al.? These types of human evaluations can be extremely sensitive to changes in the setup, even the phrasing of the task can influence results. E.g., presenting images scaled differently can mask certain artifacts. In addition, the variance between subjects can be very high. Ideally, each method included in the comparison would be re-evaluated using the same set of observers. Please include error bars.\n\nThe CelebA super-resolution task furthermore seems fairly limited. Given the extreme downsampling of the input, the task becomes similar to simply generating any realistic image. A useful baseline would be the following method: Store the entire training set. For a given query image, look for the nearest neighbor in the downsampled space, then return the corresponding high-resolution image. This trivial method might not only perform well, it also highlights a flaw in the evaluation: Any method which returns stored high-resolution images – even if they don’t match the input – would perform at 50%. To fix this, the human observers should also receive the low-resolution image and be asked to identify the correct corresponding high-resolution image.\n\nUsing multiplicative operations to model images seems important. How does the self-attention mechanism relate to “gated” convolutions used in PixelCNNs? Could gated convolutions not also be considered a form of self-attention?\n\nThe presentation/text could use some work. Much of the text assumes that the reader is familiar with Vaswani et al. (2017) but could easily be made more self-contained by directly including the definitions used. E.g., the encoding of positions using sines and cosines or the multi-head attention model. I also felt too much of the architecture is described in prose and could be more efficiently and precisely conveyed in equations.\n\nOn page 7 the authors write “we believe our cherry-picked images for various classes to be of higher perceptual quality”. This is a meaningless result, not only because the images were cherry-picked. Generating realistic images is trivial - you just need to store the training images. Analyzing samples generated by a generative model (outside the context of an application) should therefore only be used for diagnostic purposes or to build intuitions but not to judge the quality of a model.\n\nPlease consider rephrasing the last sentence of the abstract. Generating images which “look pretty cool” should not be the goal of a serious machine learning paper or a respected machine learning conference.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Image Transformer","abstract":"Image generation has been successfully cast as an autoregressive sequence generation\nor transformation problem.
