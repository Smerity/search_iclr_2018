We also used our framework to include additional results. In short, our contributions are summarized as follows:\n• Formally state the local openness property and its use in studying local/global equivalence of optimization problems arising from training non-convex deep models.\n• Provide a complete characterization of the local openness of the matrix multiplication mapping.\n• Show that every local optimum of a two layer linear network optimization problem is globally optimal. Unlike many existing results in the literature, our result requires no assumption on the target data matrix Y , and input data matrix X\n• Develop “almost complete” characterization of the local/global optima equivalence of multi- layer linear neural networks, and provide various counterexamples to show the necessity of each assumption.\n• Show global/local optima equivalence of non-linear deep models having certain pyramidal struc- ture. Unlike some existing works, our result requires no assumption on the differentiability of the activation functions and can go beyond “full-rank cases. In this case, we do agree with the reviewer that we do not allow wide intermediate layers. We explicitly mentioned this in our revised manuscript.\n\n-- Comment: If problem (4) is not considered at all in this paper (in its full generality that considers matrix completion and matrix sensing as special cases), then the authors could just start with the model in (5).\n-- Response: We revised accordingly. \n\n-- Comment: Remark 1 has a nice example - could this example be shown with Y not being the all-zeros vector?\n-- Response: For the given dimensions (m=2, k=1, n=2), it is not possible. The reason is that if both vectors are non-zero, then they are both full rank. Hence, according to our main result on local openness of the matrix product, our mapping is locally open. However, one can easily con- struct other non-zero examples for larger dimensions using our main result as our theorem provides a complete characterization.\n\n--Comment: In section 5, the authors make a connection with the work of Ge et al. 2016. They state that the problems in (10)-(11) constitute generalizations of the symmetric matrix completion case, considered in Ge et al. 2016. However, in that work, the main difficulty of proving global optimality comes from the randomness of the sampling mask operator (which introduces the notion of incoherence and requires results in expectation). It is not clear, and maybe it is an overstatement, that the results in section 5 generalize that work. If that is the case, could the authors describe this a bit further?\n-- Response: Indeed, we only consider the fully-observed matrix completion problem.

It uses the notion of a locally open map to draw equivalences between local optima and global optima. The basic idea is that for fitting nonlinear models with a convex loss, if the mapping from the weights to the outputs is open, then every local optimum in weight space corresponds to a local optimum in output space; by convexity, in output space every local optimum is global. \n\nThis is mostly a “theory building” work. With an appropriate fix, lemma 4 gives a cleaner set of assumptions than previous work in the same space (Nguyen + Hein ’17), but yields essentially the same conclusions. \n\nThe notion of local openness seems very well adapted to deriving these type of results in a clean manner. The result in Section 3 on local openness of matrix multiplication on its range (which is substantially motivated by Behrends 2017) may be of independent interest. I did not check the proof of this result in detail, but it appears to be correct. For the linear, deep case, the paper corrects imprecisions in the previous work (Lu + Kawaguchi). \n\nFor deep nonlinear networks, the results require the “pyramidal” assumption that the dimensionality is nonincreasing with respect to layer and (more restrictively) the feature dimension in the first layer is larger than the number of input points. This seems to differ from typical practice, in the sense that it does not allow for wide intermediate layers. This seems to be a limitation of the methodology: unless I'm missing something, this situation cannot be addressed using locally open maps. \n\n\n\nThere are some imprecisions in the writing. For example, Lemma 4 is not correct as written — an invertible mapping \\sigma is not necessarily locally open. Take $\\sigma_k(t) = t for t rational and -t for t irrational$ as an example.

The paper studies locally open maps, which preserve the local minima geometry. Hence a local minima of l(F(W)) is a local minima of l(s) when s=F(W) is a locally open map. Theorem 3 provides conditions under which the multiplication X*Y is a locally open map. For a pyramidal feed forward net, if the weights in each layer have full rank,  input X is full rank, and the link function is invertible, then that local minima is a global minima.  \n\nComments:\n\nThe locally open maps (Behrends 2017) is an interesting concept. However I am not convinced that the paper is able to show stronger results about the geometry of linear/neural networks. Further the claims all over the paper, comparing with the existing works. are over the top and not justified. I believe the paper needs a significant rewriting.\n\nThe results are not a strict improvement over existing works. For neural networks, Nguyen and Hein (2017) assume the link function is differentiable. This paper assumes the link function is invertible. Both papers can handle sigmoid/tanh, but cannot handle ReLU.\n\nResults for linear networks are not an improvement over existing works. Paper claims to remove assumption on Y, but they get much weaker results as they cannot differentiate between saddle points and global minima, for a critical point.  Results are also written in a confusing way as stating each critical point is a saddle or a global minima. Instead the presentation can be simplified by just discussing the equivalency between local minima and global minima, as the proposed framework cannot handle critical points directly.\n\nProof of Lemma 7 seems to have typos/mistakes. What is \\bar{W_i}? Why are the first two equations just showing d_i \\leq d_i ? How do you use this to conclude locally openness of \\mathcal{M}?\n\nAuthors claim their result extends the results for matrix completion from Ge et al. (2016) .

In that sense, the originality of the results is weak, but definitely there is some novelty in the methodology used to get to these results. Thus, I would say original.\n\nImportance: The paper deals with the important problem of when and why training algorithms might get to global/local/saddle critical points. While there are no direct connections with generalization properties, characterizing the landscape of neural networks is an important topic to make further steps into better understanding of deep learning. It will attract some attention at the conference.\n\nClarity: The paper is well-written - some parts need improvement, but overall I'm satisfied with the current version.\n\nComments:\n1.
