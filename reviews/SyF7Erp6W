We are glad that you understood the target at which we were aiming: the reduction of training time when controlling devices. Below we will try to clarify the points that you mentioned.\n\n- “No direct comparison between algorithm and existing methods is given”. For the slot car setup, we only compared our results to published data as mentioned in 2.1 (example: twelve hours to learn to drive a slot car). We did not reproduce the complex hardware setup described in the publications, as our target, described in the introduction, was to find an “alternative approach to teach computers to learn quickly to perform as efficiently as the existing solution with approximately one percent of the training data, time, and computing resources”. Neither the vision-based approach nor the added-sensors and embedded processor solution fit in this framework. The results we obtained with our own algorithm are tabulated in 4.1 and need, as written in our text, up to ten laps to learn. This leads to less than a minute of learning time, as the longest laps are less than 6 seconds (table 1). Even though no lower-bound was given for the lap time (which would indeed give an indication of how good drivers are), the minute versus hours of learning time was in line with our initial claim. “How long do other systems need? Is this a valid point to raise?” is thus answered by figures in our paper, and is going towards our original goal that we described in the introduction “to perform as efficiently as the existing solution with approximately one percent of the training data, time, and computing resources”.\n- We agree that 2.2 could have mislead the reader into thinking that we would go beyond the Atari 2600 games (only a Nintendo game is mentioned in Lee et al., 2014).\n- “A clear statement of the hypothesis and reason/motivation behind pursuing this approach is missing”. The motivation is given in the introduction, along with the targets: “algorithms that control cyberphysical systems to learn with very little data how to operate quickly in a partially-known environment” and the target is “teach computers to learn quickly to perform as efficiently as the existing solution with approximately one percent of the training data, time, and computing resources”.\n- About bibliographical references and Dreyfus: we are willing to add more references, including both explainable AI and other approaches relying on Dreyfus ideas. We only removed them from our submission to comply with the “strong recommendation” of 8+1 pages.\n- Continental based philosophy definition: we followed the classic explanation of continental philosophy as defined with respect to analytical philosophy. It is difficult to provide a definition of continental philosophy that is accepted by everyone in the field, except by opposition to analytical philosophy.\n- “Result section not well structured and results lack credibility”: if allowed to go beyond the 8+1 page, we will be glad to split the description of the experimental setup and the results. As proposed to other reviewers, we will then also spend more time explaining the results that are tabulated, and describing what really occurs while our algorithm is learning. Regarding Table 1, we mostly gave average times plus or minus the standard deviation. Example for circuit 2: 3.08+-0.54s for the human means 3.08s average, and a standard deviation from the mean (std) of 0.54s. The AI reached 3.13s for the mean value, which is worse than 3.08s for the human, however with a std of 0.02s compared to 0.54s for the human. The AI is thus more consistent than a human, while being slightly slower than the human. “Not even an average measure is given only samples. This is very suspicious”: the only samples are the best lap for the human being. All other results consist of an average and a standard deviation.\n- “Why the comparison with DQN and only DQN? How was this comparison initialised? Which parameters were used?” We agree on the lack of explanation for the term DQN, this was an oversight on our part. The comparison with the DQN was done following the publication referenced in our paper, reproducing the results using the same setup as explained in 4.2: “The tests are carried out with the settings from Mnih et al. (2015)”. As for why we choose the DQN, the reason is that this publication is one of the most cited in relation to Atari 2600 games, and is the de-facto benchmark to which one must refer. Although we aim to control cyberphysical systems, we needed to validate the versatility of our approach by first testing it on this standard.\n\nAs asked to the other reviewers, please tell us if adding a few pages to clarify the setup and the results could lead to an accepted paper. It would also include minor modifications to remove any ambiguity found by yourself and the other reviewers, including grammatical errors.\n\nSincerely yours,\nThe Authors."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Learning to play slot cars and Atari 2600 games in just minutes","abstract":"Machine learning algorithms for controlling devices will need to learn quickly, with few trials.

We are glad that you understood the target at which we were aiming: the reduction of the training time when controlling devices, and the concept we borrowed from different sciences such as philosophy and linguistics. We hope to clarify the fact that the algorithm does not need a specific training for each configuration, and that it does not always replay or “scales recorded samples of the human driving” as you mentioned.\n\nWe illustrate two cases with the slot car: the case where the car drives on the same track (bijective case), and the case where the track is unknown (analogy case). While it is true that the algorithm learns from the best lap for the bijective case, as you clearly describe in your review, the analogy case is different. In the analogy case, as written on page 7, section 4.1, the algorithm “transposes knowledge previously acquired for a different track configuration”. As there is no bijection between the two circuit configurations, there is no possibility to replay something that would have been recorded. The algorithm infers in real time, from only current and voltage measurements, that the car is in a configuration that we (humans) call curve or straight. It relies on a classifier (k-nn) with two classes. This number of classes could be expanded to higher values, that would lead to a more complex description in human terms, which would in turn defeat the purpose of this toy problem. The algorithm then chooses the best control signal based on its previous experiences (best in order to reach the goal of decreasing lap time while staying on the track). We do admit that we used the terms “straight” and “curve” in our explanation, but the algorithm simply classifies current and voltage to choose a control signal so as to stay on the track while decreasing the lap time.\n\nThe algorithm uses this past knowledge (the control signal for each class) in a previously unencountered situation. In this way it generalizes its strategy and adapts to a radically different case: circuit 2 differs from circuit 1, and a replay of a recorded strategy learned on one circuit or scaled “recorded samples of the human driving” would fail on the other circuit.\n\nThe only shortcoming we did when applying this theory for the slotcar was to skip the search for the “me”, as there is only one entity with dynamic behavior. The algorithm still applies concepts outlined in 3.2 such as the search for enemies (the enemy being a car crash).\n\nHowever, our algorithm does not “count the number of sections that the track has”: please tell us what part of our document could be improved to avoid such misunderstanding. The algorithm has absolutely no way to count such sections, nor the required sensors as far as we can tell: it only measures the voltage and the current.\n\nThe second example (Atari games) does not even rely on the bijective case, because there is no human-provided reference or gameplay. It is thus discovering everything, as in classic reinforcement learning approaches. The only hard-coded concepts are:\n- the fact that there is at least one “me” among the entities (which means, in control theory terms, that there is at least one system responding to a control signal. Its transfer function is unknown).\n- the fact that going towards friends is the first strategy to apply to survive.\nThe rest is inferred by the algorithm: the friends and the enemies are updated based on the evolution of the score function, and the control signal sent is based on this information. This is the reason why it needs a few thousands frames to start increasing the score: in the beginning, it does not properly locate the “me” or, if it does, it does not yet know who is a friend. Once it is inferred (as it is inferred with deep learning or reinforcement learning methods), only the concepts relevant for the task at hand are transferred, even if there is no bijection between the structures and the states (as explained in section 3.3).\n\n\nWe are willing to add more references, including both explainable AI and other approaches relying on Dreyfus’ ideas. We only removed them from our submission to comply with the “strong recommendation” of 8+1 pages. We can also shorten the description of the analog electronics (which we included because of the added constraint of low cost when designing this kind of new solution). We could thus spend more time explaining the results that are tabulated, and what really occurs when our algorithm is learning.\n\nPlease tell us if such modifications are within the scope of what is advised (including adding a few pages for the explanation of the results), and if it could lead to an acceptation of the paper.\n\nSincerely yours,\nThe Authors."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Learning to play slot cars and Atari 2600 games in just minutes","abstract":"Machine learning algorithms for controlling devices will need to learn quickly, with few trials.

The authors note that in real life, this type of training will outstrip both the training and time budget of most real world problems.  The solution they propose is to take a high level approach and to learn more like humans do by creating strategies that involve relationships between entities rather than trying to build up strategies from pixels. \nThe authors credit their reframing of their approach to AI to the “continental philosophers” (e.g. Heidegger) in opposition to the “analytical philosophers” such as Wittgenstein.  The authors associate current machine learning approaches with the analytic philosophers, based on propositions that are either provably true or untrue and their own approach as in opposition to these, however from my reading of this paper what the authors are saying is that if you start learning with higher level concepts (relationships between entities) rather than doing analysis on low level information such as pixels.   Starting with low level concepts makes learning very difficult at first and leads to a path where many trials are required.  Staring from higher level concepts such as relationships between entities allows learning to happen quickly and in a manner much more similar in nature to what humans actually do.\nWhile the authors bring up many valid points, and in essence I believe that they may be correct, the flaw in this paper is that they do not provide methods for teaching computers to learn these higher level concepts.  The algorithms they present all require human knowledge to be encoded in the algorithms to identify the higher level concepts.  The true power of the deep learning approach is that it can actually learn from low level data, without humans hand crafting the higher level entities on their behalf.\n\nWhile I agree with Dreyfus that understanding what is important and interesting given a situation would be an incredible boon to any AI algorithm, it remains an unsolved problem as to how to teach a computer to understand what is interesting in a scene with the same intuition that a human has.  In the first experiment the authors need to pre-define the concepts of a straight road and a curved road and identify them for the algorithm.  They also need to tell the algorithm exactly how to count the number of sections that the track has.  In the second experiment, to identify the “Me” in the game, the authors instruct the computer to recognize “me” as the things that move when the controller is activated.  While in some ways this is clever, mimicking what a child might do to see what moves in the world when it issues a command to move from its own brain and thus learning what “me” is, children take year to develop a sense of “self” and part of that is learning that a “concept of self” is an interesting and useful thing to have.  In their work the authors know, from their human intelligence, what are the important concepts in the game (again from a human perspective) and devise simple methods for the computer to learn these.  Again the problem here is that the human has to define the important concepts for the computer and define a specific strategy for the computer to learn to identify these important policies.  Data intensive deep learning algorithms are able to infer strategies without these concepts being defined for them.\n\nThis reframing does point out a different and perhaps better path for AI, but it is not entirely new and this paper does not present a method for getting from sensed data to higher level concepts.  For each of the experiments, the strategies used rely on human intuition to define policies.  In the first experiment with slot cars, a human needs to provide n laps of driving to imitate.  The authors identify the “shortest lap” and store it for the “AI” to replay.  The only “learning” is from an optimization that minimizes the difference between the AI’s lap time and the best lap time (tbest) of the human by scaling that recorded sample of the human driving.  This results is a strategy that is essentially just trying to replicate (imitate) what the human is doing will not lead to a generalizable learning strategy that could ever exceed a human example.   This is at best a very limited form of imitation learning.  The learning process for the second example is explained in even less detail.\nOverall, this paper presents a different way of thinking about AI, one in which the amount of training time and training data required for learning is greatly reduced, however what is missing Is a generalizable algorithmic strategy for implementing this framework.m  \n\n \n\n\n\n","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Learning to play slot cars and Atari 2600 games in just minutes","abstract":"Machine learning algorithms for controlling devices will need to learn quickly, with few trials.

Ideas by other authors that utilise this criticism as their foundation are conceptually similar, they could have therefore been mentioned in the related work section.\n\t•\tThe paper fails to mention the current movement in the AI community to make AI more explainable. One of their two key advantages seems to be that they develop a more intuitive explainable system. However, this movement is completely ignored and not given a single mention. The paper, therefore,  does not set their approach in context and is not able to acknowledge related work in this area. \n\t•\tThe section about continental based philosophy is rather confusing\n\t•\tInstead of explaining the philosophy, analytical philosophy is described in details and continental philosophy is only described as not following analytical patterns. A clear introduction to this topic is missing.\n\t•\tWhen described, it is stated that it's a mix of different German and French doctrines that are name dropped but not explained\\ and leave the reader confused.\n\t•\tResult section not well structured and results lack credibility:\n\t•\tLong sections in the result section describe the actual algorithm. This should have been discussed before the results.\n\t•\tResults for slot car are not convincing:\n\t•\tTable 1 only shows the first the last and the best lap (and in most of them the human is better) \n\t•\tNot even an average measure is given only samples. This is very suspicious.\n\t•\tWhy the comparison with DQN and only DQN? How was this comparison initialised? Which parameters were used? Neither is the term DQN resolved as Deep Q-Network nor is any explanation given. There are many methods/method classes performing RL on the Atari Environment. The mention of only one comparison  leaves reasonable doubt about the claim that the system learns faster.   \n \nSUMMARY: Reject. Even though the idea presented is a novel contribution and has potential the paper itself is highly unstructured and confusing and lacks a proper grammar check. No clear hypothesis is formed until section 3. The concept of Explainable AI which could have been a good motivation does not find any mentioning. Key concepts such as continental philosophy are not explained in a coherent way. The results are presented in a questionable way. As the idea is promising it is recommended to the authors to restructure the paper and conduct more experiments to be able to get accepted. \n","confidence":"2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Learning to play slot cars and Atari 2600 games in just minutes","abstract":"Machine learning algorithms for controlling devices will need to learn quickly, with few trials.
