Similar to CNNs, the use of parallel processing modules such as GPUs could drastically reduce the time spent on search procedure.\n\n\n2. \"Seems to require relevant objects and textures to be present in the training set in order to succeed at any given conditional image generation task.\"\n\nWe agree.

We will incorporate the suggestions provided in the reviews.\n\n1. \"It is not clear how well the proposed approach works with CNN architectures other than PixelNet\"\n\nWe will add experiments with other architectures. However, we believe that our approach is agnostic of a pixel-level CNN used for regression. We used PixelNet because it had been shown to work well for the various pixel-level tasks, particularly the inverse of our synthesis problems (i.e., predicting surface normals and edges from images). The use of a single network architecture for our various synthesis problems reduces variability due to the regressor and lets us focus on the nearest neighbor stage. \n\n2. \"Since the paper used “the pre-trained PixelNet to extract surface normal and edge maps” for ground-truth generation, it is not clear whether the approach will work as well when the input is a ground-truth semantic segmentation map.\n\nThis is an interesting question. We have initial results that synthesize faces from the Helen Face dataset (Smith et al, CVPR 2013) from ground-truth segmentation masks. We see qualitatively similar behaviour. In many cases we even see better performance because the input signal (i.e., the ground-truth segmentation labels) are of higher quality than the edges/normals we condition on. We will add such an analysis and discussion.\n\n3. \"Since the paper describes a computer-vision image synthesis system and not a new theoretical result, I believe reporting the actual run-time of the system will make the paper stronger. Can PixelNN run in real-time? How does the timing compare to Isola et al’s Conditional GAN?\" \n\nOur approximate neighbor neighbor search (described on Page 6) takes .2 fps. We did not optimize our approach for speed. Importantly, we make use of a single CPU to perform our nearest neighbor search, while Isola et al makes use of a GPU. We posit that GPU-based nearest-neighbor libraries (e.g., FAISS) will allow for real-time performance comparable to Isola’s.

The approach is compared to Isola et al’s conditional adversarial networks, and unlike the conditional GAN, is able to produce a diverse set of outputs.\n\nOverall, the paper describes a computer visions system based on synthesizing images, and not necessarily a new theoretical framework to compete with GANs. With the current focus of the paper being the proposed system, it is interesting to the computer vision community. However, if one views the paper in a different light, namely showing some “blind-spots” of current conditional GAN approaches like lack of diversity, then it can be of much more interest to the broader ICLR community.\n\nPros: \nOverall the paper is well-written\nMakes a strong case that random noise injection inside conditional GANs does not produce enough diversity\nShows a number of qualitative and quantitative results\n\nConcerns about the paper:\n1.) It is not clear how well the proposed approach works with CNN architectures other than PixelNet\n2.) Since the paper used “the pre-trained PixelNet to extract surface normal and edge maps” for ground-truth generation, it is not clear whether the approach will work as well when the input is a ground-truth semantic segmentation map.\n3.) Since the paper describes a computer-vision image synthesis system and not a new theoretical result, I believe reporting the actual run-time of the system will make the paper stronger. Can PixelNN run in real-time? How does the timing compare to Isola et al’s Conditional GAN?\n\nMinor comments:\n1.) The paper mentions making predictions from “incomplete” input several times, but in all experiments, the input is an edge map, normal map, or low-resolution image. When reading the manuscript the first time, I was expecting experiments on images that have regions that are visible and regions that are masked out. However, I am not sure if the confusion is solely mine, or shared with other readers.\n\n2.) Equation 1 contains the norm operator twice, and the first norm has no subscript, while the second one has an l_2 subscript. I would expect the notation style to be consistent within a single equation (i.e., use ||w||_2^2, ||w||^2, or ||w||_{l_2}^2)\n\n3.) Table 1 has two sub-tables: left and right.
