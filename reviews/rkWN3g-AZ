We take note that the experiments section and comparison to baselines are lacking. In the following, we propose some clarifications to the specific issues raised in the review:\n\nSemantic style transfer\n-------------------------------\nWe introduce the semantic style transfer keyword as a distinction to pixel-level translation tasks. While the notion of \"unsupervised image-to-image translation\" should be general enough, in recent work, this task often refers to pixel-level translation, where the input and output images have very similar structure (e.g., as you mentioned: horses to zebras, sunny to rain). Instead, we focused on translation tasks allowing for significant structure changes while retaining semantic content, such as the face-to-cartoon task introduced in DTN. \n\nLoss redundancy\n-----------------------\nThe semantic consistency [a] and domain-adversarial loss [b] are indeed redundant (in the sense that low value of [a] implies low value of [b]) when the model perfectly maps inputs to the correct target domain; however this is not necessarily the case in practice, e.g. at the beginning of training. \nMore specifically, the domain-adversarial [b] loss makes embeddings from D1 and D2 lie in close subspaces, while the semantic consistency loss makes embedding e1(x) close to e2 o d2 o e1(x) (and vice-versa) for a specific input x in D1. Hence, [a] is a stronger constraint than [b]. However, in the case where the decoder d2 does not properly maps to the target domain D2  (e.g., at the beginning of training, the generated faces are not realistic until the GAN kicks in), then [a] does not bring any information about embeddings from real D2 samples, contrary to [b].\n\nComparison to baselines\n---------------------------------\nThe main differences with the UNIT paper [b] is we impose stronger constraints on the learned embeddings, i.e. we make use of (i) the domain-adversarial loss [c] and (ii) the semantic consistency loss (rather than pixel-level cycle consistency) to constrain the learned embedding explicitly, while UNIT only relies on weight sharing in the encoder. We will include the COGAN reference in future revisions.\n\n\nExperimental validation\n-------------------------------\nWe did not thoroughly investigate previous pixel-level translation tasks as they were not our main focus, but we agree that additional experiments would definitely support the proposed model. \nWe also experimented on SVHN to MNIST to compare to the DTN baseline, however we did not observe significant improvement in the classification accuracy compared to these baselines. We omitted these results as they did not seem significant enough for a task like MNIST classification.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"XGAN: Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation for many-to-many Mappings","abstract":"Style transfer usually refers to the task of applying color and texture information from a specific style image to a given content image while preserving the structure of the latter.

The model is very similar to DTN [Taigman et al. 2016] except with trained encoders and a domain confusion loss to encourage the encoders to map source and target domains to a shared embedding. Additionally, an optional teacher network is introduced, but this feels rather tangential and problem-specific. The paper is clearly presented and I enjoyed the aesthetics of the figures. The method appears technically sound, albeit a bit complicated. The new cartoon dataset is also a nice contribution.\n\nMy main criticism of this paper is the experiments. At the end of reading, I don’t know clearly which aspects of the method are important, why they are important, and how the proposed system compares against past work. First, the baselines are insufficient. Only DTNs are compared against, yet there are many other recent methods for unpaired image-to-image translation, notably, cycle-consistency-based methods and UNIT. These methods should also be compared against, as there is little evidence that DTNs are actually SOTA on cartoons (rather, the cartoon dataset was not public so other papers did not compare on that dataset). Second, although I appreciated the ablation experiments, they are not comprehensive, as discussed more below. Third, there is no quantitative evaluation. The paper states that quantifying performance on style transfer is an unsolved problem, but this is no excuse for not at least trying. Indeed, there are many proposed metrics in the literature for quantifying style transfer / image generation, including the Inception score [Salimans et al. 2016], conditional variants like the FCN-score [Isola et al. 2017], and human judgments. These metrics could all be adapted to the present task (with appropriate modifications, e.g., switching from Inception to a face attribute classifier). Additionally, as the paper mentions at the end, the method could be applied to domain adaptation, where plenty of standard metrics and benchmarks exist.\n\nUltimately, the qualitative results in the paper are not convincing to me. It’s hard to see the advantages/disadvantages in each comparison. For example in Figure 8, it’s hard to even see any overall change in the outputs due to ablating the semantic consistency loss and the teacher loss (especially since I’m comparing these to Figure 6, which is referred to “Selected results” and therefore might not be a fair comparison). Perhaps the effect of the ablations would be clearer if the figures showed a single input followed by a series of outputs for that same input, each with a different term ablated. A careful reader might be able to examine the images for a long time and find some insights, but it would be much better if the paper distilled these insights into a more concise and convincing form. I feel sort of like I’m looking at raw data, and it still needs to be analyzed.\n\nI also think the ablations are not sufficiently comprehensive. In particular, there is no ablation of the domain adversarial loss. This seems like an important one to test since it’s one of the main differences from DTNs. I was a bit confused by the “finetuned DTN” in Section 7.2. Is this an ablation experiment where the domain adversarial loss and teacher loss are removed? If so, referring to it as so may be clearer than calling it a finetuned DTN. Interestingly, the results of this method look pretty decent, suggesting that the domain adversarial loss might not be having a big effect, in which case XGAN looks very close indeed to DTNs. It would be great here to actually quantify the mentioned sensitivity to hyperparameters.\n\nIn terms of presentation, at several points, the paper argues that previous, pixel-domain methods are more limited than the proposed feature-space method, but little evidence is given to support these claims. For example, “we argue that such a pixel-level constraint is not sufficient in our case” in the intro, and “our proposed semantic consistency loss acts at the feature level, allowing for more flexible transformations” in related work. I would like to see more motivation for these assertions, and ultimately, the limitations should be concretely demonstrated in experiments. In models like CycleGAN the pixel-level constraint is between inputs and reconstructed inputs, and I don’t see why this necessarily is overly restrictive on the kinds of transformations in the outputs. The phrasing in the current paper seems to suggest that the pixel-level constraints are between input and output, which, I agree, would be directly restrictive. The reasoning here should be clarified. Better yet would be to provide empirical evidence that pixel-domain methods are not successful (e.g., by comparing against CycleGAN).\n\nThe usage of the term “semantic” is also somewhat confusing. In what sense is the latent space semantic? The paper should clarify exactly what this term refers to, perhaps simply defining it to mean a “low-dimensional shared embedding.”\n\nI think the role of the GAN objective is somewhat underplayed. It is quite interesting that the current model achieves decent results even without the GAN. However, there is no experiment keeping the GAN but ablating other parts of the method. Other papers have shown that a GAN objective plus, e.g., cycle-consistency, can do quite well on this kind of problem. It could be that different terms in the current objective are somewhat redundant, so that you can choose any two or three, let’s say, and get good results. To check this, it would be great to see more comprehensive ablation experiments. \n\n\nMinor comments:\n1. Page 1: I wouldn’t call colorization one-to-one. Even though there is a single ground truth, I would say colorization is one-to-many in the sense that many outputs may be equally probable according to a Bayes optimal observer.\n2. Fig 1: It should be clarified that the left example is not a result of the method. At a glance this looks like an exciting new result and I think that could mislead casual readers.\n3.

Here, a domain is collectively defined by the images of the same style, e.g., cartoon faces. \n\nThe cost function used to train the network consists of five terms of which four are pretty standard: a reconstruction loss, two regular GAN-type losses, and an imitation loss. The fifth term, called the semantic consistency loss, is one of the main contributions of this paper. This loss ensures that the translated images should be encoded into about the same location as the embedding of the original image, albeit by different encoders. \n\nStrengths:\n1. The new CartoonSet dataset is carefully designed and compiled. It could facilitate the future research on style transfer. \n2. The paper is very well written. I enjoyed reading the paper. The text is concise and also clear enough and the figures are illustrative.\n3. The semantic consistency loss is reasonable, but I do not think this is significantly novel. \n\nWeaknesses:\n1. Although “the key aim of XGAN is to learn a joint meaningful and semantically consistent embedding”, the experiments are actually devoted to the qualitative style transfer only. A possible experiment design for evaluating “the key aim of XGAN” may be the facial attribute prediction. The CartoonSet contains attribute labels but the authors may need collect such labels for the VGG-face set.\n2. Only one baseline is considered in the style transfer experiments. Both CycleGAN and UNIT are very competitive methods and would be better be included in the comparison. \n3. The “many-to-many” is ambiguous. Style transfer in general is not a one-to-one or many-to-one mapping. It is not necessary to stress the many-to-many property of the proposed new task, i.e., semantic style transfer. \n\nThe CartoonSet dataset and the new task, which is called semantic style transfer between two domains, are nice contributions of this paper. In terms of technical contributions, it is not significant to have the X-shaped GAN or the straightforward semantic consistency loss. The experiments are somehow mismatched with the claimed aim of the paper.

To be more precise, the proposed method utilizes the weight-sharing design for enforcing the shared latent space constraint proposed in the UNIT work [b] and the feature consistency loss term for ensuring common embedding in the DTN work [a] for solving the ill-posed unpaired/unsupervised image-to-image translation problem. Since the ideas are already published in the prior work, the paper does not contribute additional knowledge to the problem. \n\nIn addition, the combination is done in a careless manner. First of all, the paper proposes jointly minimizing the common embedding loss [a] and the domain adversarial loss [b]. However, minimizing the common embedding loss [a] also results in minimizing the domain adversarial loss [c]. This can be easily seen as when the embeddings are the same, no discriminators can tell them apart. This suggests that the paper fails to see the connection and blindly put the two things together. Moreover, given the generators, minimizing the common embedding loss also results in minimizing the cycle-consistency loss [d]. As the UNIT work [b] utilize both the weight-sharing constraint and cycle-consistency loss, the proposed method becomes a close variant to the UNIT work [b].\n\n- Poor experimental verification\n\nThe paper only shows visualization results on translating frontal face images to cartoon images in the resolution of 64x64. This is apparently short as compared to the experimental validations done in several prior works [a,b,d]. In the CycleGAN work [d], the results are shown on several translation tasks (picture to painting, horse to zebra, map to image, and different scenarios) in a resolution of 256x256. In the UNIT work [b], the results are shown in various street scene (sunny to rainy, day to night, winter to summer, synthetic to real) and animal portraits (cat species and dog breeds) where the resolution is up to 640x480. In the DTN [a] and UNIT [b] work, promising domain adaptation results (SVHN to MNIST) are reported. Due to the shortage of results, the credibility of the paper is damaged. \n\n- Lack of clarity in presentation\n\nThe paper tends to introduces new key words for existing one. For example, the \"semantic style transfer\" is exactly the unpaired/unsupervised image-to-image translation or cross-domain image generation. It is not clear why the paper needs to introduce the new keyword. Also, the Coupled GAN work [e] is the first work that utilizes both weight-sharing (shared latent space assumption) and GAN for unpaired/unsupervised image-to-image translation. It is unfortunately that the paper fails to refer to this closely related prior work.\n\n[a] Yaniv Taigman, Adam Polyak, Lior Wolf \"Unsupervised Cross-Domain Image Generation\", ICLR 2017\n\n[b] Ming-Yu Liu, Thomas Breuel, Jan Kautz \"Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation Networks\", NIPS 2017 \n\n[c] YaroslavGanin et al. \"Domain-adversarial Training of Neural Networks\" JMLR 2016\n\n[d] Jun-Yan Zhu, Taesung Park, Philip Isola, and Alexei A.
