The error is then given by: (\\phi(a,b,x) - y)^2 (where \\phi is applied elementwise).\nThe error derivative at (a,b) is therefore:\n\n\tG = [ (max{0, ax} - max{0, cx} ) * Ind{ax>0} x, (max{0, bx} - max{0, dx}) * Ind{bx>0} x ]\n\nThe Frobenius inner product is then given by:\n\n        <G, (a,b) - (c, d) >_F = (a-c)(max{0, ax}- max{0, cx}) *Ind{ax>0}x +  (b-d)(max{0, bx}- max{0, dx})*Ind{bx>0}x\n\nThis is always >= 0 (each term in the sum is >= 0).\n\nAnother way of looking at a single multi-output layer is that each output and the weights with which it is associated is, in fact, our original GLM problem which we have shown to be SLQC in Theorem 3.4.

Please find our responses below (we have also uploaded a revised paper draft with the appropriate content based on these responses):\n\nR3: “every layer can be treated a generalized linear model...the SLQC property only applies for the last layer…”\nR2: “Do we still have local-quasi-convexity for the weights of each layer, when there are multiple nonlinear layers above it?”\n\nThe SLQC property does hold for the intermediate layers as well. It is important to note, however, that the SLQC property holds with respect to the input to the corresponding intermediate layer. (Section 3.3 in the latest version of the paper clarifies this.)\n\nR1: “Experimental results for classification are not convincing enough...Table 1….SGD outperforms….and is competent with DANTE...”\nR1: “The results on reconstruction do not show benefits for DANTE (over SGD)…”\nR2: “In the experiments, the authors found the network optimized by the proposed algorithm generalize better than regular SGD. Is this result consistent (across dataset, random initializations, etc)?”\n\nWe would like to clarify that we propose DANTE (and thus, an alternating minimization strategy) as a competitive alternative to backpropagation-based SGD, and our results corroborate this claim. While this was conveyed in our earlier version too, we have revised any choice of words that may have suggested otherwise. This comparable performance is consistent across all our experiments and studies.\n\nR2: “In the experiments, the authors plotted the training progress w.r.t. the minibatch iterations, I do not know if the minibatch iteration is a proxy for actual runtime (or number of floating point operations).”\nMinibatch iterations is in fact a proxy for actual runtime in these experiments, and on measuring the time taken for the experiments in Figure 2, we found the times taken are indeed comparable.\n\nR1: “When dealing with a 2 layer network where there are 2 matrices W_1, W_2 to optimize over. It is not clear to me why optimizing over W_1 is a quasi-convex optimization problem? The authors seem to use the idea that solving a GLM problem is a quasi-convex optimization problem. However, optimizing w.r.t. W_1 is definitely not a GLM problem, since W_1 undergoes two non-linear transformations one via \\phi_1 and another via \\phi_2. Could the authors justify why minimizing w.r.t. W_1 is still a quasi-convex optimization problem?”\n\nR1: “...autoencoders, which are functions from R^d -> R^d’. However, GLMs are functions from R^d ---> R. So, it is not at all clear to me how Theorem 3.4, 3.5 and eventually 3.6 are useful for the autoencoder problem...” \n\nWe have revised Section 3.3 (as well as included additional results in our Appendix) to clarify these questions. \n\nIn the DANTE algorithm (Algorithm 2 of paper), it is evident that each node of the output layer presents a GLM problem (and hence, SLQC) w.r.t. the corresponding weights from W_2. We show in Appendices A.2 and A.3 how the entire layer is SLQC w.r.t. W_2, by generalizing the definition of SLQC to matrices. In case of W_1, while the problem may not directly represent a GLM, we show in Appendix A.3 that our generalized definition of SLQC to functions on matrices allows us to prove that Step 4 of Algorithm 2 is also SLQC w.r.t. W_1, thus allowing us to use Theorems 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 for our formulation.\n\nR3: “It will be interesting if the authors can provide an analysis/relate to some theory related to alternating minimization of bi-quasi-convex objectives. Concretely: Is there any known theory for such objectives? What guarantees can we hope to achieve?”\n\nWe are definitely interested in this question ourselves, and this will form an important direction of our future work. To the best of our knowledge, there are no such known guarantees for this setting. \n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Training Autoencoders by Alternating Minimization","abstract":"We present DANTE, a novel method for training neural networks, in particular autoencoders, using the alternating minimization principle.

The central idea is that a single encoder-decoder network can be cast as an alternating minimization problem. Each minimization problem is not convex but is quasi-convex and hence one can use stochastic normalized gradient descent to minimize w.r.t. each variable. This leads to the proposed algorithm called DANTE which simply minimizes w.r.t. each variable using stochastic normalized gradient algorithm to minimize w.r.t. each variable The authors start with this idea and introduce a generalized ReLU which is specified via a subgradient function only whose local quasi-convexity properties are established. They then extend these idea to multi-layer encoder-decoder networks by performing greedy layer-wise training and using the proposed algorithms for training each layer. The ideas are interesting, but I have some concerns regarding this work.\n\nMajor comments:\n\n1. When dealing with a 2 layer network where there are 2 matrices W_1, W_2 to optimize over. It is not clear to me why optimizing over W_1 is a quasi-convex optimization problem? The authors seem to use the idea that solving a GLM problem is a quasi-convex optimization problem. However, optimizing w.r.t. W_1 is definitely not a GLM problem, since W_1 undergoes two non-linear transformations one via \\phi_1 and another via \\phi_2. Could the authors justify why minimizing w.r.t. W_1 is still a quasi-convex optimization problem?\n\n2. Theorem 3.4, 3.5 establish  SLQC properties with generalized RELU activations. This is an interesting result, and useful in its own right. However, it is not clear to me why this result is even relevant here. The main application of this paper is autoencoders, which are functions from R^d -> R^d. However, GLMs are functions from R^d ---> R. So, it is not at all clear to me how Theorem 3.4, 3.5 and eventually 3.6 are useful for the autoencoder problem that the authors care about. Yes they are useful if one was doing 2-layer neural networks for binary classification, but it is not clear to me how they are useful for autoencoder problems.\n\n3. Experimental results for classification are not convincing enough. If, one looks at Table 1. SGD outperforms DANTE on ionosphere dataset and is competent with DANTE on MNIST and USPS. \n\n4. The results on reconstruction do not show any benefits for DANTE over SGD (Figure 3). I would recommend the authors to rerun these experiments but truncate the iterations early enough. If DANTE has better reconstruction performance than SGD with fewer iterations then that would be a positive result.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Training Autoencoders by Alternating Minimization","abstract":"We present DANTE, a novel method for training neural networks, in particular autoencoders, using the alternating minimization principle.

I think the paper is borderline, leaning towards accept.\n\nI do want to note my other concerns:\n\nI suspect the theoretical results obtained here are somewhat restricted to the least-squares, autoencoder loss.  \n\nAnd note that the authors show that the proposed algorithm performs comparably to SGD, but not significantly better. The classification result (Table 1) was obtained on the autoencoder features instead of training a classifier on the original inputs. So it is not clear if the proposed algorithm is better for training the classifier, which may be of more interest.\n\n=============================================================\n\nThis paper presents an algorithm for training deep neural networks. Instead of computing gradient of all layers and perform updates of all weight parameters at the same time, the authors propose to perform alternating optimization on weights of individual layers. \n\nThe theoretical justification is obtained for single-hidden-layer auto-encoders. Motivated by recent work by Hazan et al 2015, the authors developed the local-quasi-convexity of the objective w.r.t. the hidden layer weights for the generalized RELU activation. As a result, the optimization problem over the single hidden layer can be optimized efficiently using the algorithm of Hazan et al 2015. This itself can be a small, nice contribution.\n\nWhat concerns me is the extension to multiple layers. Some questions are not clear from section 3.4:\n1. Do we still have local-quasi-convexity for the weights of each layer, when there are multiple nonlinear layers above it? A negative answer to this question will somewhat undermine the significance of the single-hidden-layer result.\n\n2. Practically, even if the authors can perform efficient optimization of weights in individual layers, when there are many layers, the alternating optimization nature of the algorithm can possibly result in overall slower convergence. Also, since the proposed algorithm still uses gradient based optimizers for each layer, computing the gradient w.r.t. lower layers (closer to the inputs) are still done by backdrop, which has pretty much the same computational cost of the regular backdrop algorithm for updating all layers at the same time. As a result, I am not sure if the proposed algorithm is on par with / faster than the regular SGD algorithm in actual runtime. In the experiments, the authors plotted the training progress w.r.t. the minibatch iterations, I do not know if the minibatch iteration is a proxy for actual runtime (or number of floating point operations).\n\n3.
