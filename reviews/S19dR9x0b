That is, we use 45000 images for training, another 5000 for validation, and the remaining 10000 for testing. The images are preprocessed with global contrast normalization and ZCA whitening. We also use the VGG-like architecture:\n\n(2×128C3)−MP2−(2×256C3)−MP2−(2×512C3)−MP2−(2×1024FC)−10SVM,\n\nwhere C3 is a 3×3 convolution layer, and MP2 is a 2×2 max-pooling layer. Batch Normalization, with a mini-batch size of 50, and ADAM are used. The maximum number of epochs is 200. The learning rate starts at 0.02 and decays by a factor of 0.5 after every 30 epochs. The testing error rates for 2-bit weight and 1-bit activation are as follows:\n\nAlternating (our method):                                                             11.70%\nRefined (our implementation):                                                     12.08%\nXNOR-Net (1-bit weight & 1-bit activation, reported in [1])    12.62%\nFull Precision (reported in [1])                                                      11.90%          \nwhere our alternating quantization method achieves the lowest test error rate. \n \nQ2: “Including another experiment not based on text (speech recognition / synthesis, audio, biological, signals, ...) to see how it generalizes to other kind of data” by Reviewer 3\n\nReply: As a simple illustration, we conduct experiments on the sequential MNIST (images of size 28×28) classification task [2]. In every time, we sequentially use one row of the image as the input (of size 28×1), which results in a total of 28 time steps. We use 1 hidden layer’s LSTM of size 128 and the same optimization hyper-parameters as the Language Models in our paper. The testing error rates for 1-bit input, 2-bit weight, and 2-bit activation are as follows:\n\nFull Precision (our implementation)          1.10%\nAlternating (our method)                            1.19%\nRefined (our implementation)                    1.39%\nwhere our alternating quantized method still achieves plausible performance in this task. \n \nWe will add all the above experiments in the revised version.\n\n[1] Hou, Lu, et al.

The time costs during training can also be divided into two parts: the forward and backward pass.

It does quantization by tackling $\\min_{\\alpha, t}\\|w – \\alpha* t \\|_2^2$ with $t$ restricted to {-1,0,+1}. However, currently there is no efficient algorithm to solve this problem. Instead, Li et al. [1] suggested to empirically set the entries $w_i$ with absolute scales less than $0.7/n \\|w\\|_1$ to 0 (n is the number of entries) and binarize the left entries with a closed-form solution as discussed in our paper. In fact, ternary quantization is a special case of the 2-bit quantization in our paper, i.e., $\\min_{\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2, b_1,b_2}\\|w – \\alpha_1* b_1 - \\alpha_2 * b_2 \\|_2^2$ with an additional constraint that $\\alpha_1 = \\alpha_2$. Thus our alternating multi-bit quantization method can easily extend to solve it.\n\nIn parallel to our binarized quantization, vector quantization is applied to compress the weights for feedforward neural networks [2][3]. Different from ours where all weights are directly constraint to {-1, +1}, vector quantization learns a small codebook by applying k-means clustering to the weights or conducting product quantization. The weights are then reconstructed by indexing the codebook. It has been shown that by such a technique, the number of parameters can be reduced by an order of magnitude with limited accuracy loss [2]. It is possible that our mutli-bit quantized binary weight can be further compressed by using the product quantization. However, this is out-of-the scope of this paper and we leave it for future work.\n\nWe will incorporate the above discussions in the revised version. As for the experiment on image classification tasks, we have done on MNIST (see the replies to common issues). We will also report the results on CIFAR10 if time permits.\n\n[1] Li, Fengfu et al.

Below are some clarifications for issues concerned in common:\n\nQ1: “Acceleration for binary multiplication on CPU, both in theory and real implementation”\n\nReply: As the binary multiplication operates in 1 bit, whereas the full precision multiplication operates in 32 bit, despite the feasible implementations, the acceleration should be 32x in theory (Not 64x as claimed in XNOR-NET[1], the acceleration claimed in our paper was calculated based on this wrong factor. We will correct it in the revised version). In addition to binary operation, in real implementations, the acceleration can be largely affected by the size of the matrix, where much memory reduce can result in better utilizing in the limited cache (it is much faster than CPU main memory).  \n\nIn this work, we implement the binary multiplication kernel in CPUs ourselves. The binary multiplication is divided into two steps: Entry-wise XNOR operation (corresponding to entry-wise product in the full precision multiplication) and bit count operation for accumulation (corresponding to compute the sum of all multiplied entries in the full precision multiplication). We test it on Intel Xeon E5-2682 v4 @ 2.50GHz CPU. For the XNOR operation, we use the Single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) _mm256_xor_ps, which can execute 256 bit simultaneously. For the bit count operation, we use the function _popcnt64 (Note that this step can further be accelerated by the up-coming instruction _mm512_popcnt_epi64, which can execute 512 bits simultaneously. Similarly, the XNOR operation can also be further accelerated by the up-coming _mm512_xor_ps instruction to execute 512 bits simultaneously). We compare with the much optimized Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) on full precision matrix vector multiplication and execute all codes in the single-thread mode. We conduct two scales of experiments: a matrix of size $4096 \\times 1024$ multiplying a vector of size $1024 \\times 1$ and a matrix of size $42000 \\times 1024$ multiplying a vector of size $1024 \\times 1$, which respectively correspond to the hidden state product $W_h h_{t-1}$ and the softmax layer $W_s h_t$ for Text8 dataset during inference with batch size =1 (See Eq. (6) in the paper).\n\nFor a matrix of size $4096 \\times 1024$ multiplying a vector of size $1024 \\times 1$, we have\n\nFull precision:   1.95ms\n2-bit:          0.35ms (including 0.07ms for on-line quantizing the vector, taking 20%)\n3-bit:          0.72ms (including 0.11ms for on-line quantizing the vector, taking 15%)\n\nin which our 2-bit quantization has 5.6x acceleration and our 3-bit quantization has 2.7x acceleration.\n\nFor a matrix of size $42000 \\times 1024$ multiplying a vector of size $1024 \\times 1$, we have\n\nFull precision:  19.10ms\n2-bit:          3.17ms (including 0.07ms for on-line quantizing the vector, taking 2%)\n3-bit:          6.46ms (including 0.11ms for on-line quantizing the vector, taking 1.7%)\n\nin which our 2-bit quantization has 6x acceleration and our 3-bit quantization has 3x acceleration.\n\nNote that this is only a simple test on CPU. Our alternating quantization method can also be extended to GPU, ASIC, and FPGA.\n\nFinally, we deem that it may be too demanding to compare the speedups by pushing the limit of implementation. The exact number of speedups may vary across different computing devices and also depends on how much the compliers can be optimized. Our research is anyway valuable by showing the theoretical potential and inspiring future exploration.\n \nQ2: “Illustration of experiments using feedforward neural networks”:\n\nReply: We conduct a classification task on MNIST and compare with existing work [2]. Besides the weights and activations, the input images are also quantized. The method proposed in [2] is intrinsically a greedy multi-bit quantization method. For fair comparison, we follow the same setting. We use the MLP consisting of 3 hidden layers of 4,096 units and an L2-SVM output layer. No convolution, preprocessing, data augmentation or pre-training is used. We also use ADAM with an exponentially decaying learning rate and Batch Normalization with a batch size 100. The testing error rates for 2 bit input, 2 bit weight, and 1 bit activation are as follows:\n\nFull Precision (our implementation):           0.97%\nAlternating (our method):                            1.13%\nRefined (our implementation):                    1.22% \nGreedy (reported in [2]):                              1.25%   \n\nAmong all the compared multi-bit quantization methods, our alternating one achieves the lowest the testing error.\n\nWe will add all the above discussions and experiments in the revised version.\n\n[1] Rastegari, Mohammad, et al.

I am increasing my score to 7.\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nThe paper proposes a technique for quantizing neural network weight matrices by representing columns of weight matrices as linear combinations of binary (+1/-1) vectors. Given a weight vector, the paper proposes an alternating optimization procedure to estimate the set of k binary vectors and coefficients that best represent (in terms of MSE) the original vector. This yields a k-bit quantization. First, the coefficients/binary weights are initialized using a greedy procedure proposed in prior work. Then, the binary weights are updated using a clever binary search procedure, followed by updates to the coefficients. Experiments are conducted in an RNN context for some language modeling tasks.\n\nThe paper is relatively easy to read, and the technique is clearly explained. The technique is as far as I can tell novel, and does seem to represent an improvement over existing approaches for similar multi-bit quantization strategies.\n\nI have a few questions/concerns. First, I am quite skeptical of many of the speedup calculations: These are rather delicate to do properly, and depend on the specific instructions available, SIMD widths, the number of ALUs present in a core, etc. All of these can easily shift numbers around by a factor of 2-8x. Without an implementation in hand, comparing against a well-optimized reference GEMM for full floating point, it's not clear how much faster this approach really would be in practice. Also, the online quantization of activations doesn't seem to be factored into the speedup calculations, and no benchmarks are provided demonstrating how fast the quantization is (unless I'm missing something). This is concerning since the claimed speedups aren't possible without the online quantization of actiations.\n\nIt would have been nice to have more discussion of/comparison with other approaches capable of 2-4 bit quantization, such as some of the recent work on ternary quantization, product quantization approaches, or at least scalar (per-dimension) k-means (non-uniform quantization).\n\nFinally, the experiments are reasonable, but the choice of RNN setting isn't clear to me. It would have been easier to compare to prior work if the experiments also included some standard image classification tasks (e.g., CIFAR10).\n\nOverall though, I think the paper does just enough to warrant acceptance.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Alternating Multi-bit Quantization for Recurrent Neural Networks","abstract":"Recurrent neural networks have achieved excellent performance in many applications.

To do an full binary inner-product MAC (i.e. xnor, popcount, accumulate) on an Intel CPU with AVX2 (until AVX512's popcount is available), the peak is approximately 256 GOP/cycle or so via xnor (issues on 3 ports, 1/3 of a cycle) and a fast popcnt method (e.g. Harley-Seal for larger reductions, lookup for smaller reductions in https://github.com/WojciechMula/sse-popcount/blob/master/results/skylake/skylake-i7-6700-gcc5.3.0-avx2.rst, which work out at a little bit over 2 cycles/vector in the best case). An equivalent Intel CPU can execute 2 fp32 AVX2 FMAs per cycle, which is a throughput of 32 FLOPs/cycle. Ignoring AVX2 thermal throttling, 1bit/1bit inner products vs fp32/fp32 inner products are then sped up by a factor of about 10x or so (and lower for Skylake's AVX-512 FMAs). \n\nThus, when you have to do 4 binary inner products (for 2b/2b inner products), your ideal theoretical speedup is 10x / 4 = 2.5x or so.

Also, in the paper it is shown how the matrix multiplications of the quantized model can be speeded up using 64 bits operation in CPU. This is, not only saves memory storage and usage, but also on runtime calculation using CPU, which is an important characteristic when there are limited computational resources.\n\nResults on language models show that the models with quantized weights with 3 bits obtain the same or even slightly better performance on the tested datasets with impressive speed-ups and memory savings.\n\nFor completeness, it would be interesting, and I would strongly encourage to add a discussion or even an experiment using feedforward DNN with a simple dataset as MNIST, as most of previous work discussed in the paper report experiments on DNN that are feedforward.

However, on portable devices with limited resources, the models are often too large to deploy. For applications on the server with large scale concurrent requests, the latency during inference can also be very critical for costly computing resources. In this work, we address these problems by quantizing the network, both weights and activations, into multiple binary codes {-1,+1}. We formulate the quantization as an optimization problem. Under the key observation that once the quantization coefficients are fixed the binary codes can be derived efficiently by binary search tree, alternating minimization is then applied.  We test the quantization for two well-known RNNs, i.e., long short term memory (LSTM) and gate recurrent unit (GRU), on the language models. Compared with the full-precision counter part, by 2-bit quantization we can achieve ~16x memory saving and  potential ~13.5x   inference acceleration on CPUs, with only a reasonable loss in the accuracy. By 3-bit quantization, we can achieve almost no loss in the accuracy or even surpass the original model, with ~10.5x memory saving and potential ~6.5x inference acceleration. Both results beat the exiting quantization works with large margins.
