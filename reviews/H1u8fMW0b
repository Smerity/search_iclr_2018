Sorry to insist but the predictive policy presented in this paper is a direct derivation of Friston active inference principle (minimize Evidence lower bound with action). The trick is to consider the latent state as coding for the entire scene (which only visible in parts). Each partial view thus allows to refine the estimation of z, which in turn makes the next perception less \"surprising\" (i.e. lowers E_q -log P(x|z, u) for all u). So please reconsider your statement for it is quite deceiving to other reviewers and readers. \nNext the Free Energy principle is a coding optimization principle so it is neither blind or watchful to rewards, it depends how you formulate your problem (this being not the subject though). \nThe active inference framework is not \"much different\" for it has tight relations with the active vision litterature and grounds on the same probabilistic framework (partial observation of a scene, bayesian inference etc..). The static simplification is also extremely classic and present in most cited papers, so it is not unusual at all. This is finally quite a bunch of surprising comments though not critically related to the actual content of the paper!\n \nNext the fovea-based model is given with full implementation detail. Pages 5-6 provide everything needed to reproduce the numerical experiments. \nLast, more comparisons with existing models should indeed be done though there is little room for improvement in the current setting. The missing part/future work  being comparing inhibition of return simplification with trajectory-based optimization. \n\nWe also tried to better separate in the new version the review part from the contributions. Apart from the introduction, most of the related work has been pushed to p.8.

The posterior entropy minimization from action selection directly derives from free energy minimization first principles (see Friston et al 2012 ref in paper that links free energy to posterior entropy minimization). By the way surprise reduction is an objective in itself that can be set up as a reward (an ‘intrinsic’ reward) with possible connections with reinforcement learning “extrinsic” rewards and action optimization.\nSecond, the steady state assumption (nothing changes in the scene) is not that uncommon in active vision (see previous comment). Maybe are you puzzled by the difference between a visual scene (the entire image) that doesn’t change (but is covered) and and a view (which is the current perception given viewpoint u) which changes at each saccade?\nThird, a comparison with low-level Itti & Koch saliency models is not relevant here for the MNIST images are not “natural” enough (no texture, flat background etc.). The saliency maps that we build relate to the critical viewpoints where discriminating features are expected (high-level / recognition oriented saliency maps).  \nAdditional details should be put in the final version regarding the effect of H_ref on classification rates, the comparison with baseline (full image) recognition, random saccades, two-steps ahead predictive policy and pre-processed (high-level saliency maps based) policyn, see : \nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1wFvPUgiN7ekaAaIAQ5KMHgA-H0plttv2\nLast remark : the apparent realism of the saccades relates to the full image coverage but you are right this is not quantified here. \n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Toward predictive machine learning for active vision","abstract":"We develop a comprehensive description of the active inference framework, as proposed by Friston (2010), under a machine-learning compliant perspective.

The differences with our work are however substantial. A quite common mistake made in ref. 1 is to define the objective as the one-step forward reconstruction accuracy. This may coincide with the recognition accuracy in special cases, but should fail in most cases (as already pointed out in 2. and 3). In contrast, papers 2 and 3 are about trajectory-based policy optimization with policy learned from a continuous belief vector with function approximators (namely Policy gradient in 2., Monte Carlo/RBF in 3.).\nIn our case the policy is not learned but directly processed (optimized) from the generative model. The trick is to do a local optimization using a “two-steps ahead” prediction that predicts the next posterior (the effect of the next observation), consistently with Friston’s active inference/predictive coding approach. Another substantial difference is our scene decoding/feature selection approach that contrasts with the standard visual search tasks and provides a link with classical ML setups. \nThose references will be included in the final version with appropriate comments / comparisons.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Toward predictive machine learning for active vision","abstract":"We develop a comprehensive description of the active inference framework, as proposed by Friston (2010), under a machine-learning compliant perspective.

The active vision/sensing problem has been well studied and both the information theory and Bayes risk formulations have already been considered in previous works (see Najemnik and Geisler, 2005; Butko and Movellan, 2010; Ahmad and Yu, 2013).\n\nThe paper is also rife with spelling mistakes and grammatical errors and needs a thorough revision.
