This reduces reproducibility.\nSorry for such confusion. We use the losses formed by the forward dynamics given in Theorem 1 as training objective, and use Adam to find the learning rate and momentum at each time steps that minimize that training objective. The meta training learning rate is 0.003, and it is trained for 500 meta training steps. We added this description in our revised version.\n\nQ2: Figure 4 misses the red trajectories, also it would be easier to have colors on the same (log?)-scale. \nMeta-descent on 20k is time-consuming to run. Since the visualized hyper-surface is smooth, we expect that meta-descent will behave as expected to converge to the local minimum.  We will add the red trajectory in the next version of the paper.\n\nQ3: Why the loss function looks so vastly different with different look-ahead? \nMore number of look-ahead means more optimization steps. The loss will go lower as one trains longer.\n\nQ4. page 2: \"But this would come at the expense of long-term optimization process\": at this point of the paper it is not clear how or why this should happen.

","comment":"Q1: Why 1000 SGD+mom steps pre-training steps were needed?\nWe want to choose a setting that our observation is less sensitive to which part of training. If we always start looking ahead at zeroth step, then there is a higher chance that the optimal hyperparameter is only fitted to the beginning; whereas if we start at some pre-trained steps, e.g. 1000, then the optimal hyperparameter is more likely to generalize to, say 500 or 5000 steps.\n\nQ2: Which is the real issue, noise or curvature?\nThe problem will arise if you have both noise in the objective and different curvature directions. We showed that in a deterministic problem, the greedy optimal learning rate and momentum is optimal as it is essentially doing conjugate gradient, regardless of how many different curvature directions you have. We also showed in theorem 3 that the greedy learning rate is optimal if the curvature is spherical.  On the other hand, if thereâ€™s noise in the objective, and there are many different curvature directions the problem will arise. This is because, the noise in the objective forbids one to completely get rid of the loss on a particular direction. Hence, one should always first remove the loss on low curvature directions and then move onto high curvature directions. But short-horizon objective encourages the opposite because high curvature directions gives most rapid decrease in loss. Therefore, both noise in the objective and different curvature directions cause the problem.\n\nQ3: Figure 2: 1. Show fixed learning rate. 2. Thickness of the red curve. 3. Upper bound.\nFigure 2 is edited as reviewer suggests. Also the reviewer is correct that we upper bounded the learning rate to avoid the loss on any curvature direction becoming larger than its initial value, so as to assure the quadratic assumption. We added the description in the revised version.\n\nQ4: Figure 4: 1. Add a color bar to indicate numerical values for the different grayscale values.\nThanks for the suggestion.

Backpropagation through an optimization process requires unrolling the optimization, which due to computational and memory constraints, is typically restricted or truncated to a smaller number of unrolled steps than we would like.\n\nThis paper highlights this problem as a fundamental issue limiting meta-optimization approaches. The authors perform a number of experiments on a toy problem (stochastic quadratics) which is amenable to some theoretical analysis as well as a small fully connected network trained on MNIST.  \n\n(side note: I was assigned this paper quite late in the review process, and have not carefully gone through the derivations--specifically Theorems 1 and 2).\n\nThe paper is generally clear and well written.\n\nMajor comments\n-------------------------\nI was a bit confused why 1000 SGD+mom steps pre-training steps were needed. As far as I can tell, pre-training is not typically done in the other meta-optimization literature? The authors suggest this is needed because \"the dynamics of training are different at the very start compared to later stages\", which is a bit vague. Perhaps the authors can expand upon  this point?\n\nThe conclusion suggests that the difference in greedy vs. fully optimized schedule is due to the curvature (poor scaling) of the objective--but Fig 2. and earlier discussion talked about the noise in the objective as introducing the bias (e.g. from earlier in the paper, \"The noise in the problem adds uncertainty to the objective, resulting in failures of greedy schedule\"). Which is the real issue, noise or curvature? Would running the problem on quadratics with different condition numbers be insightful?\n\nMinor comments\n-------------------------\nThe stochastic gradient equation in Sec 2.2.2 is missing a subscript: \"h_i\" instead of \"h\"\n\nIt would be nice to include the loss curve for a fixed learning rate and momentum for the noisy quadratic in Figure 2, just to get a sense of how that compares with the greedy and optimized curves.\n\nIt looks like there was an upper bound constraint placed on the optimized learning rate in Figure 2--is that correct? I couldn't find a mention of the constraint in the paper. (the optimized learning rate remains at 0.2 for the first ~60 steps)?\n\nFigure 2 (and elsewhere): I would change 'optimal' to 'optimized' to distinguish it from an optimal curve that might result from an analytic derivation. 'Optimized' makes it more clear that the curve was obtained using an optimization process.\n\nFigure 2: can you change the line style or thickness so that we can see both the red and blue curves for the deterministic case? I assume the red curve is hiding beneath the blue one--but it would be good to see this explicitly.\n\nFigure 4 is fantastic--it succinctly and clearly demonstrates the problem of truncated unrolls. I would add a note in the caption to make it clear that the SMD trajectories are the red curves, e.g.: \"SMD trajectories (red) during meta-optimization of initial effective ...\". I would also change the caption to use \"meta-training losses\" instead of \"training losses\" (I believe those numbers are for the meta-loss, correct?). Finally, I would add a colorbar to indicate numerical values for the different grayscale values.\n\nSome recent references that warrant a mention in the text:\n- both of these learn optimizers using longer numbers of unrolled steps:\nLearning gradient descent: better generalization and longer horizons, Lv et al, ICML 2017\nLearned optimizers that scale and generalize, Wichrowska et al, ICML 2017\n- another application of unrolled optimization:\nUnrolled generative adversarial networks, Metz et al, ICLR 2017\n\nIn the text discussing Figure 4 (middle of pg. 8) , \"which is obtained by using...\" should be \"which are obtained by using...\"\n\nIn the conclusion, \"optimal for deterministic objective\" should be \"deterministic objectives\"","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":2,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Understanding Short-Horizon Bias in Stochastic Meta-Optimization","abstract":"Careful tuning of the learning rate, or even schedules thereof, can be crucial to effective neural net training.

There has been much recent interest in gradient-based meta-optimization, where one tunes hyperparameters, or even learns an optimizer, in order to minimize the expected loss when the training procedure is unrolled. But because the training procedure must be unrolled thousands of times, the meta-objective must be defined with an orders-of-magnitude shorter time horizon than is typical for neural net training. We show that such short-horizon meta-objectives cause a serious bias towards small step sizes, an effect we term short-horizon bias. We introduce a toy problem, a noisy quadratic cost function, on which we analyze short-horizon bias by deriving and comparing the optimal schedules for short and long time horizons. We then run meta-optimization experiments (both offline and online) on standard benchmark datasets, showing that meta-optimization chooses too small a learning rate by multiple orders of magnitude, even when run with a moderately long time horizon (100 steps) typical of work in the area.
