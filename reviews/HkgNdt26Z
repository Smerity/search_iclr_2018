Our method gives good privacy guarantees and provides low communication cost (compared to previous results).\n\nLet me cite my answer to the previous reviewer.\n\n\"In the works on Federated Learning issued so far each node is considered only as a client in distributed learning system for gradient calculation. In our approach we guarantee that the model sent to the aggregation server is at the same time the actual model used for typing and gives the best performance for the end user. It is guaranteed by the forgetting prevention mechanism. It has at least following advantages: 1) No need  for synchronization after every iteration as in standard Federated learning scheme. Standard Federated learning uses no more than 20 iterations on each device for reduction of the communication cost (McMahan et al. 2016, https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629) while we send our models only once in an epoch thus significantly reducing the communication cost. ; 2) Simpler synchronization scheme on the server; 3) Faster convergence; 4) Only 1 model is stored on the disk. We think that these results may be interesting to many ML practitioners.\"\n\n2) \"KSS seems to need the user study\". - KSS is measured according to the formula (5) given in the paper. The process of testing automatization seems obvious.  No user testing is needed. (comp. WER calculation for ASR). In any case perplexity results are also given for all experiments.\n\n3) As far as you didn't discuss the privacy analysis part which was included into the contributions list I'll cite my previous comment again:\n\n\"We consider our contribution significant at least for the following reason. To our knowledge deep neural networks have never been checked for differential privacy coming from the randomness of the training algorithm (combination of SGD, dropout regularization and model averaging in our case). Existing approaches (e.g. Papernot et al. 2017, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.05755.pdf) suggest adding random noise at different stages of training leading to the tradeoff between accuracy and privacy.

The authors assume that the global model will depict general english. However, it is not necessary that the population of users will adhere to general English and hence the averaged model at the next time step t+1 might be significantly different from general English. It is not clear to me as how this mechanism guarantees that it will not over-fit or that there will be no catastrophic forgetting.\"\n\nIn our problem statement we consider general English to be the common language i.e. the commonly used language with statistically insignificant portion of user-specific expressions. It is NOT necessarily the language induced by our in-house corpus. As far as we have a model averaged on many users on the server we can treat this model as general language model. So at each stage T the server-side model represents general language. When the model is sent to the device it is updated according to the user data so there is a risk of catastrophic forgetting. We prevent it by using (eventually) random rehearsal on device (only!). \n\n2) I also would like to draw your attention to the original and practically relevant problem statement.
