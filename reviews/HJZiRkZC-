The proposed network offers scalability, operates at the byte-level using a fixed length one-hot encoding vector as input, and  includes a recursive structure to prevent trivial encoding. Results are presented on three languages and compared to other architectures.","rating":"5: Marginally below acceptance threshold","review":"The paper aims to illustrated the representation learning ability of the convolutional autoencoder with residual connections is  proposed by to encode text at the byte level.  The authors apply the proposed architecture to 3 languages and run comparisons with an LSTM.  Experimental results  with different perturbation of samples, pooling layers, and sample lengths are presented.\n\nThe writing is fairly clear, however the presentation of tables and figures could be done better, for example, Fig. 2 is referred  to in page 3,  Table 2 which contains results is referred to on page 5, Fig 4 is referred to in page 6 and appears in page 5, etc.\n\nWhat kind of minimal preprocessing is done on the text? Are punctuations removed? Is casing retained? How is the space character encoded?\n\nWhy was the encoded dimension always fixed at 1024?  What is the definition of a sample here?\n\nThe description of the various data sets could be moved to a table/Appendix, particularly since most of the results are presented on the enwiki dataset, which would lead to better readability of the paper.  Also results are presented only on a random 1M sample selected from these data sets, so the need for this whole page goes away.\n\nComparing Table 2 and Table 3, the LSTM is at 67% error on the test set while the proposed convolutional autoencoder is at 3.34%.  Are these numbers on the same test set?    While the argument that the LSTM does not generalize well due to the inherent memory learnt is reasonable, the differences in performance cannot be explained away with this. Can you please clarify this further?\n\nIt appears that the byte error shoot up for sequences of length 512+ (fig. 6 and fig. 7) and seems entirely correlated with the amount of data than recursion levels.\n\nHow do you expect these results to change for a different subset selection of training and test samples? Will Fig. 7 and Fig. 6 still hold?\n\nIn Fig, 8, unless the static train and test error are exactly on top of the  recursive errors, they are not visible.  What is the x-axis in Fig. 8?  Please also label axes on all figures. \n\nWhile the datasets are large and would take a lot of time to process for each case study, a final result on the complete data set, to illustrate if the model does learn well with lots of data would have been useful.  A table showing generated sample text would also clarify the power of the model.\n\nWith the results presented,  with a single parameter setting, its hard to determine what exactly the model learns and why.","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Byte-Level Recursive Convolutional Auto-Encoder for Text","abstract":"This article proposes to auto-encode text at byte-level using convolutional networks with a recursive architecture.

It works on the character level and contains a recursive structure which scales with the length of the input text. Building on the recent state-of-the-art in terms of architectural components, the paper shows the feasibility of this architecture and compares it to LSTM, showing the cnn superiority for auto-encoding.\n\nThe authors have decided to encode the text into a length of 1024 - Why? Would different lengths result in a better performance?\n\nYou write \"Minimal pre-processing is applied to them since our model can be applied to all languages in the same fashion.\" Please be more specific. Which pre-processing do you apply for each dataset?\n\nI wonder if the comparison to a simple LSTM network is fair. It would be better to use a 2- or 3-layer network. Also, BLSTM are used nowadays.\n\nA strong part of this paper is the large amount of investigation and extra experiments.\nMinor issues:\nPlease correct minor linguistic mistakes as well as spelling mistakes. In Fig. 3, for example, the t of Different is missing.\n\nAn issue making it hard to read the paper is that most of the figures appear on another page than where they are mentioned in the text.\n\nthe authors have chosen to cite a work from 1994 for the vanishing gradient problem. Note, that many (also earlier) works have reported this problem in different ways. A good analysis of all researches is performed in Hochreiter, S., Bengio, Y., Frasconi, P., and Schmidhuber, J.
