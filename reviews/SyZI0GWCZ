To find the first point „on“ (i.e. close to) the boundary, we just perform a line search between the initial point and the original. As you said, this is indeed not crucial and it would be perfectly fine to leave out this step and directly follow the actual algorithm of the Boundary Attack. We use the line search because it basically just gives us a better starting point and therefore speeds up the beginning of the attack.\n\nRegarding your first sentence, we’d like to add that the Boundary Attack does not just pose a new threat, it also makes measuring the robustness of models more reliable. In the past virtually all defence strategies proposed in the literature did not actually increase the robustness of the model but only disabled the attack strategy. A prime example is gradient masking where the backpropagated gradient needed in gradient-based attacks is simply zero (e.g. defensive distillation). The Boundary Attack is robust to many such nuisances and will make it easier to spot whether a model is truly robust.\n\nWe improved the introduction to make the paper more self-contained and thus easier to to read for people not familiar with the area.

We agree that a theoretical analysis of the decision boundaries of neural networks is an important area of future work. One assumption of the attack is that the boundary is fairly smooth, otherwise the linearity assumption in the proximity of the current adversarial wouldn’t hold. Other then that the success of the attack very much depends on the number and distribution of local minimas on the boundary, but that’s true for all attacks. So just as the success of stochastic gradient descent is first and foremost an empirical result, so is the success of the Boundary Attack and it will be challenging (yet interesting) to get better theoretical insights in the future. \n\n2. The Boundary Attack is by no means restricted to CNNs. However, virtually all papers on adversarial attacks from recent years were evaluated on CNNs in computer vision tasks and so we followed this setup in order to be as accountable as possible. Of course, we do not claim that the Boundary Attack will work equally well on all Machine Learning algorithms, but that’s something no attack can legitimately claim (including gradient-based attacks). In other words, the Boundary Attack is in principle applicable to any machine learning algorithm but how well it will perform is an empirical question that future work will highlight. We’d thus choose to leave the title as is in order to stimulate more progress in this direction.\n\n3. We thank you for these pointers to relevant prior work which have prompted us to adapt the claims of the manuscript accordingly. More concretely, we now delineate our work more clearly as the first decision-based attack that scales to complex machine learning algorithms (such as DNNs) and complex data sets (such as ImageNet).\n\nWe also added more explanations as to our definition of an “adversarial”.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Decision-Based Adversarial Attacks: Reliable Attacks Against Black-Box Machine Learning Models","abstract":"Many machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to almost imperceptible perturbations of their inputs.

We have added two new figures to address your comments (figures 5 and 6).\n\n- It is true that the Boundary Attack needs a fair number of calls until it converges to the absolute minimal perturbation. In most practical scenarios, however, it is sufficient to generate adversarials that are perceptually indistinguishable from the original image in which case a much smaller number of iterations is necessary. We added figure 6 to show how fast the size of the perturbation is reduced by the Boundary Attack.\n\n- The Boundary Attack is made to find minimal perturbations from a given image that is misclassified (or classified as a certain target). More graphically, it tries to find an image that is classified as a bus but clearly looks like a cat. In the case you mentioned - Face ID - one would try to find any image that is classified as a certain target. In other words: you’d try to find an image that is classified as a bus, and it’s completely fine if it also looks like a bus to humans. That’s a totally different threat scenario that we do not consider in the paper.\n\n- All results shown in the paper are for a single run of the Boundary Attack, there is no cherry picking. To make this point clearer we added figure 5 where we show the result of ten runs of the Boundary Attack on the same image with random initialization.

Most importantly, this definition is independent of human perception but is only relative to the original image. To goal of the attack is to make the difference between the adversarial and the original image as small as possible.\n\n> Given that you only report the median, could you comment on the maximum L2 perturbation norm of adversarial inputs your approach produces in your experiments?\n\nFor VGG-19 on ImageNet in the untargeted setting the maximum L2 perturbation is as follows:\n\nFGSM: 2.2e-2\nDeepFool: 1.8e-4\nBoundary Attack: 7.1e-5 \nCarlini & Wagner: 4.8e-5\n\n> How do you guarantee that all inputs produced are individually adversarial?\n\nThe Boundary Attack starts from an adversarial image and stays within the adversarial region. Thus, the result of the attack is guaranteed to be adversarial.\n\n> In the literature, attack papers report the success rate in addition to the perturbation norm, which helps better evaluate their effectiveness.\n\nI find the success rate to be fairly meaningless: an attack should always be successful if it works correctly, the question is just how large the perturbation needs to be until one gets an adversarial.\n\n>  producing a single adversarial [...] requires more queries than needed to train a substitute model [...] or compute the gradients in a gradient-based attack. \n\nObviously gradient-based attacks need fewer model calls, but that’s simply because the gradient yields a lot of information about the model. Training a substitute model doesn’t need any calls to the original model but then there are no guarantees that the adversarials will transfer (they do empirically, but that might change with future architectures). Furthermore, a few thousand calls are totally sufficient for the Boundary Attack to produce adversarials that can hardly be distinguished from the original image. One just needs millions of queries if one really tries to find the absolute minimum perturbation.\n\n> Furthermore, your algorithm is initialized with an input that is already adversarial.\n\nFinding an initial adversarial is easy: just take any image from a different class. Of course, the distance to the original image is high initially, but that changes over the course of the optimisation. I think the confusion here is related to how we define adversarial images (see above). We’ll clarify that more clearly in the manuscript.\n\n> Could you comment on the number of queries needed to evade the Clarifai model?\n\nFor each image around 2000 - 4000 calls where needed. The attack was untargeted and we only produced the images you find in the article.\n\n> a natural defense strategy would be to reject the queries based on their large number and similarity to one-another.\n\nSurely with proper engineering one can have a chance to detect this attack (but also to evade the defence by properly distributing the calls over clients and time), but this argument can be used against basically all attacks other then transfer attacks (which have their own problems) and FGSM (if one has access to gradients). On a different note, the Boundary Attack is not only about security but also about evaluating the robustness of models as it is not so easily fooled by things like gradient masking.\n\n> In the abstract, you state that transfer-based attacks \"need access to the training data\" but later point to a work that does not need this adversarial capability [http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3052973.3053009].\n\nThe work you cite is not a classical transfer attack but we qualify it as a decision-based attack because it needs strictly less knowledge then transfer attacks.\n\n> In the introduction, you state that gradient-based attacks can be defended against by masking gradients. However, this is wrong as pointed out by prior work that you cited.\n\nThat prior work makes precisely the point that gradient-based attacks fail due to gradient masking (that’s basically by definition!). The papers show this by making certain interventions that remove gradient masking (after which the gradient-based attacks work again).\n\n> However, the related work you cite also includes experiments on a dataset of traffic sign images (GTRSRB).\n\nWe’ve extended this sentence to include the traffic sign images. Basically, the variant of transfer attacks you are pointing to will work on any dataset for which the intra-class variability is low, but this is not true for CIFAR and ImageNet (and most other interesting datasets).\n\n> The draft claims that the attack works on all machine learning models but only evaluates on CNNs.\n\nThere is nothing in the Boundary Attack that restricts it to CNNs. CNNs are just the class of models that basically all relevant prior work has been evaluated on, and so we follow this direction."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Decision-Based Adversarial Attacks: Reliable Attacks Against Black-Box Machine Learning Models","abstract":"Many machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to almost imperceptible perturbations of their inputs.

I however found that the presentation and scope of the paper claims misrepresent results included in the evaluation. \n\nThe draft does not include a threat model describing what you consider to be an adversarial example.  This is especially important given that the only metric used in the evaluation, which you proposed in Equation 4, differs from metrics used by all previous work in the literature. Given that you only report the median, could you comment on the maximum L2 perturbation norm of adversarial inputs your approach produces in your experiments? How do you guarantee that all inputs produced are individually adversarial? In the literature, attack papers report the success rate in addition to the perturbation norm, which helps better evaluate their effectiveness.\n\nCould you elaborate on the cost of your attacks? You make the strong claim that the attack is easier to mount than a transfer-based attack and \"performs on par with gradient-based attacks\" as written in the conclusion. Yet, producing a single adversarial example with the attack proposed requires more queries than needed to train a substitute model in a transfer-based attack or compute the gradients in a gradient-based attack. This means that if the adversary is interested in scaling the attack to find multiple inputs misclassified by the model, it will potentially need to make millions of additional queries. Furthermore, your algorithm is initialized with an input that is already adversarial. Do you include the queries needed to find such an input in the cost of your attack? \n\nCould you also comment on the number of queries needed to evade the Clarifai model? Where these attacks targeted or untargeted? How many adversarial examples did you produce that successfully attacked the Clarifai model?\n\nRelated to the attack's cost, have you considered how the attack will fare against detection by the defender: all queries made are very similar to each other so it seems like a natural defense strategy would be to reject the queries based on their large number and similarity to one-another. \n\nI also found several inconsistencies, which you might be able to clarify: \n\nIn the abstract, you state that transfer-based attacks \"need access to the training data\" but later point to a work that does not need this adversarial capability [http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3052973.3053009].\n\nIn the introduction, you state that gradient-based attacks can be defended against by masking gradients. However, this is wrong as pointed out by prior work that you cited [http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04311, http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3052973.3053009, http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01547]. \n\nWhen comparing to prior work in decision-based attacks [http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3052973.3053009], you state that \"While this approach works well on MNIST it has yet to be shown that it scales to more complex natural datasets such as CIFAR or ImageNet.\" However, the related work you cite also includes experiments on a dataset of traffic sign images (GTRSRB). \n\nThe draft claims that the attack works on all machine learning models but only evaluates on CNNs.

Highly relevant prior work was overlooked and there is no theoretical analysis, but I think this paper still makes a valuable contribution worth sharing with a broader audience.\n\nWhat this paper does well:\n- Suggests a type of attack that hasn't been applied to image classifiers\n- Proposes a simple heuristic method for performing this attack\n- Evaluates the attack on both benchmark neural networks and a commercial system \n\nProblems and limitations:\n\n1. No theoretical analysis. Under what conditions does the boundary attack succeed or fail? What geometry of the classification boundaries is necessary? How likely are those conditions to hold? Can we measure how well they hold on particular networks?\n\nSince there is no theoretically analysis, the evidence for effectiveness is entirely empirical. That weakens the paper and suggests an important area of future work, but I think the empirical evidence is sufficient to show that there's something interesting going. Not a fatal flaw.\n\n2. Poor framing. The paper frames the problem in terms of \"machine learning models\" in general (beginning with the first line of the abstract), but it only investigates image classification. There's no particular reason to believe that all machine learning algorithms will behave like convolutional neural network image classifiers. Thus, there's an implicit claim of generality that is not supported.\n\nThis is a presentation issue that is easily fixed. I suggest changing the title to reflect this, or at least revising the abstract and introduction to make the scope clearer.\n\nA minor presentation quibble/suggestion: \"adversarial\" is used in this paper to refer to any class that differs from the true class of the instance to be disguised. But an image of a dalmation that's labeled as a dalmation isn't adversarial -- it's just a different image that's labeled correctly. The adversarial process is about constructing something that will be mislabeled, exploiting some kind of weakness that doesn't show up on a natural distribution of inputs. I suggest rewording some of the mentions of adversarial.\n\n3. Ignorance of prior work. Finding deceptive inputs using only the classifier output has been done by Lowd and Meek (KDD 2005) for linear classifiers and Nelson et al. (AISTATS 2010, JMLR 2012) for convex-inducing classifiers. Both works include theoretical bounds on the number of queries required for near-optimal adversarial examples. Biggio et al. (ECML 2013) further propose training a surrogate classifier on similar training data, using the predictions of the target classifier to relabel the training data. In this way, decision information from the target model is used to help train a more similar surrogate, and then attacks can be transferred from the surrogate to the target.\n\nThus, \"decision-based attacks\" are not new, although the algorithm and experiments in this paper are. \n\n\nOverall, I think this paper makes a worthwhile contribution, but needs to revise the claims to match what's done in the paper and what's been done before.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Decision-Based Adversarial Attacks: Reliable Attacks Against Black-Box Machine Learning Models","abstract":"Many machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to almost imperceptible perturbations of their inputs.

This new class of attacks on deep learning systems requires from an attacker only the knowledge of class labels (previous attacks required more information, e.g., access to a gradient oracle). Unsurprisingly, since the attacker has so few information, such kind of attacks involves quite a lot trial and error. The authors propose one specific attack instance out of this class of attacks. It works as follows.\n\nFirst, an initial point outside of the benign region is guessed. Then multiple steps towards the decision boundary is taken, finally reaching the boundary (I am not sure about the precise implementation, but it seems not crucial; the author may please check whether their description of the algorithm is really reproducable). Then, in a nutshell, a random walk on a sphere centered around the original, benign point is performed, where after each step, the radius of the sphere is slightly reduced (drawing the point closer to the original point), if and only if the resulting point still is outside of the benign region.\n\nThe algorithm is evaluated on the following datasets: MNIST, CIFAR, VGG19, ResNet50, and InceptionV3.\n\nThe paper is rather well written and structured. The text was easy to follow. I suggest that a self-contained description of the problem setting (assumptions on attacker and defender; aim?) shall be added to the camera-ready version (being not familiar with the area, I had to read a couple of papers to get a feeling for the setting, before reviewing this paper). As in many DL papers these days, there really isn't any math in it worth a mention; so no reason here to say anything about mathematical soundness. The authors employ a reasonable evaluation criterion in their experiments: the median squared Euclidean distance between the original and adversarially modified data point. The results show consistent improvement for most data sets. \n\nIn summary, this is an innovative paper, proposing a new class of attacks that totally makes sense in my opinion. Apart from some minor weaknesses in the presentation that can be easily fixed for the camera ready, this is a nice, fresh paper, that might spur more attacks (and of course new defenses) from the new class of decision-based attacks. It is worth to note that the authors show that distillation is not a useful defense against such attacks, so we may expect follow-up proposing useful defenses against the new attack (which BTW is shown to be about a factor of 10 in terms of iterations more costly than the SOTA).","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Decision-Based Adversarial Attacks: Reliable Attacks Against Black-Box Machine Learning Models","abstract":"Many machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to almost imperceptible perturbations of their inputs.

So far it was unclear how much risk adversarial perturbations carry for the safety of real-world machine learning applications because most methods used to generate such perturbations rely either on detailed model information (gradient-based attacks) or on confidence scores such as class probabilities (score-based attacks), neither of which are available in most real-world scenarios. In many such cases one currently needs to retreat to transfer-based attacks which rely on cumbersome substitute models, need access to the training data and can be defended against. Here we emphasise the importance of attacks which solely rely on the final model decision. Such decision-based attacks are (1) applicable to real-world black-box models such as autonomous cars, (2) need less knowledge and are easier to apply than transfer-based attacks and (3) are more robust to simple defences than gradient- or score-based attacks. Previous attacks in this category were limited to simple models or simple datasets. Here we introduce the Boundary Attack, a decision-based attack that starts from a large adversarial perturbation and then seeks to reduce the perturbation while staying adversarial. The attack is conceptually simple, requires close to no hyperparameter tuning, does not rely on substitute models and is competitive with the best gradient-based attacks in standard computer vision tasks like ImageNet. We apply the attack on two black-box algorithms from Clarifai.com. The Boundary Attack in particular and the class of decision-based attacks in general open new avenues to study the robustness of machine learning models and raise new questions regarding the safety of deployed machine learning systems.
