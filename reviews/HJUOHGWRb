When the nets are trained on contexts \"C\" (e.g. satellite images associated with a neighborhood) related to an input \"X\" (e.g. categorical features describing the neighborhood); and a graphical model relates \"X\" to targets \"Y\" (e.g. binary variable encoding poverty level of the neighborhood), then the proposed combination can produce interpretable explanations for its predictions.\nThis approach compares favorably with post-hoc explanation methods like LIME in experiments on conducted on images (CIFAR-10, MNIST), text (IMDB reviews) and time series (Satellite dataset). The paper is clearly written and might inspire follow-up work in other applications. The description of related work is sparse (beyond a derivation of an equivalence with LIME in some settings, explained in the appendix).\nThe experiments study interesting effects: what happens when the model relating X and Y is degraded (e.g. by introducing noise into X, or sub-selecting X). The paper can be substantially improved by studying the effect of dictionary size and sparsity regularization more thoroughly.\n","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Contextual Explanation Networks","abstract":"We introduce contextual explanation networks (CENs)---a class of models that learn to predict by generating and leveraging intermediate explanations.

The contexts can be learned by, in principle, any model including neural networks, while the final predictions are supposed to be made by some simple models like linear ones. The probabilistic model allows for the simultaneous training of explanation and prediction parts as opposed to some recent post-hoc methods.\n\nThe experimental part of the paper considers variety of experiments, including classification on MNIST, CIFAR-10, IMDB and also some experiments on survival analysis. I should note, that the quality of the algorithm is in general similar to other methods considered (as expected). However, while in some cases the CEN algorithm is slightly better, in other cases it appears to sufficiently loose, see for example left part of Figure 3(b) for MNIST data set. It would be interesting to know the explanation. Also, it would be interesting to have more examples of qualitative analysis to see, that the learned explanations are really useful. I am a bit worried, that while we have interpretability with respect to intermediate features, these features theirselves might be very hard to interpret.\n\nTo sum up, I think that the general idea looks very natural and the results are quite supportive. However, I don't feel myself confident enough in this area of research to make strong conclusion on the quality of the paper.","confidence":"2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Contextual Explanation Networks","abstract":"We introduce contextual explanation networks (CENs)---a class of models that learn to predict by generating and leveraging intermediate explanations.

W., Paninski, L., & Cunningham, J. P. (2016). NIPS or Johnson, M., Duvenaud, D. K., Wiltschko, A., Adams, R. P., & Datta, S. R. (2016). NIPS. also, is there any methodological advancement essential to CENs? \n\nthe other idea is to go context specific. this idea has been present in language modeling, for example, amortized embedding models like M. Rudolph, F. Ruiz, S. Athey, and D. Blei (2017). NIPS and L. Liu, F. Ruiz, S. Athey, and D. Blei.  (2017). NIPS. application to medical data is interesting. but it could be helpful for the readers to understand if the idea in this work is fundamentally different from these previous ideas from amortized inference.\n\na final thing. a common challenge with composing graphical models and neural networks (in interpretable or uninterpretable ways) is that the neural networks will usually eat up all the representational power. the variance captured by graphical models becomes negligible. to this end, the power of graphical models for interpretability is limited. interpretability in this case is not much different from fitting only a neural network, taking the penultimate layer to the output as \"context specific features\" can claim that we are composing a linear model with a neural network, and the linear model is interpretable. it would be interesting to be clear about how the authors get around this issue.","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Contextual Explanation Networks","abstract":"We introduce contextual explanation networks (CENs)---a class of models that learn to predict by generating and leveraging intermediate explanations.
