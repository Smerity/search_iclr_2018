First, we would like to clarify the main contribution of our work: the proposed model, DCRNN, achieves significant performance gain with theoretical justifications -  we derive diffusion convolution from the property of random walk [1] capturing the diffusion nature of traffic. And we show in theory that the popular spectral convolution, i.e., ChebNet [2], is a special case of our method (Proposition 2.2). We further incorporate diffusion convolution with RNN in a non-trivial way and improve long-term forecasting performance with scheduled sampling. Compared with existing work, our model is one of the first with significant performance improvement in traffic prediction and insightful theoretical justifications. \n\nBelow we address specific questions/concerns:\n>> \"Compared to the existing spectral graph convolution approach, it is still not clear how its performance will be by using the same number of parameters.\"  \nIn Table 2, we compare to ChebNet [4], one of the most popular spectral graph convolutions with roughly the same number of parameters, and our approach achieves improved results.\n\nHere is the detailed architecture of these models:\nDCRNN (proposed model),  K=3, #layers=2,  # filters in each layer=64, #params=373,376 \nGCRNN (ChebNet + GRU), K=3, #layers=2,  # filters in each layer=83, #params=376,156\n\n>> Comparison with DeepTransport [3].\n\nDeepTransport [3] is a very recent unpublished work and has not been peer-reviewed, it first becomes available on arXiv on Sep 27th, 2017. In [3], the authors model the spatial dependency by explicitly collecting upstream and downstream roads for each individual road and then conduct traditional convolution on these roads respectively. Comparing with [3], we model the spatial dependency in a more systematic way, i.e., generalizing convolution to the traffic sensor graph based on the diffusion nature of traffic. Besides, we derive DCRNN from the property of random walk and show that the popular spectral convolution ChebNet is a special case of our method.\n\nWe will reference and differentiate those work in the next version.\n\nReference:\n[1] S.

However, we cannot agree with the reviewer’s assessment regarding the significance of this paper. The paper proposes a novel Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network which captures both the spatial and temporal dependencies among traffic time series with theoretical justifications. We derive diffusion convolution from the property of random walk [1] capturing the diffusion nature of traffic, and we show in theory that the popular spectral convolution, i.e., ChebNet [2], is a special case of our method (Proposition 2.2). We further incorporate diffusion convolution with RNN in a non-trivial way and improve long-term forecasting performance with scheduled sampling. Compared with existing work, our model is one of the first with significant performance improvement in traffic prediction and insightful theoretical justifications. \n\nBelow we address specific questions/concerns:\n\n>> \"The paper lacks a comparison to other models that aim to include spatiotemporal dependencies used for this problem - namely Gaussian Processes, spatial k-NN.\"\n\nWe do compare models that consider spatial and temporal dependencies, e.g., VAR and FC-LSTM, which take as input time series from all sensors, and model both the dependency among different sensors and the dependency among different time steps. \n\nComparison with Gaussian Processes (GPs) [3] and Spatial KNN [4]:\n- GPs are hard to scale to the large dataset and are generally not suitable for relatively long-term traffic prediction like 1 hour (i.e.,12 steps ahead), as the variance can be accumulated and becomes extremely large.\n- Though spatial KNN [4] considers both the spatial and the temporal dependencies, it has the following drawbacks:\n    1) As shown in [5], Spatial KNN performs independent forecasting for each individual road. The prediction of a road is a weighted combination of its own historical traffic speeds. This makes it hard for Spatial KNN to fully utilize information from neighbors.\n    2) Spatial KNN is a non-parametric approach and each road is modeled and calculated separately [5], which may make it hard to generalize to unseen situations and to scale to large datasets. \n   3) In Spatial KNN, all the similarities are calculated using hand-designed metrics with few learnable parameters which may limit its representation power. \n\nWe will add more discussion about these methods in the next version.\n\n>> \"The paper motivates the goal to obtain smooth traffic predictions...\" \nOur motivation is to capture the temporal and spatial dependency among traffic time series rather than to generate smooth predictions. The reviewer may misunderstand the description of Fig. 6. Though in Fig. 6, we show that the model's predictions are usually smooth, this is not our motivation. The smoothness can be explained by the following facts:\n- The objective is to predict the traffic speed averaged over 5 mins which is usually smooth even with traffic lights and intersections.\n- The traffic speed time series are collected from the highway where traffic lights and intersections are less common.\n\nBesides, for clarification, by saying \"traffic signal\" we mean the graph signal of traffic as described in Section 2.1 rather than \"traffic light\".\n\n>> \"The method performs well on the presented data - in comparison to the models that do not consider autocorrelation\"\nIn fact, most baselines that our method beat do consider autocorrelation. For example, VAR, FC-LSTM, which take as input multiple time series, are able to model the autocorrelation among different time series and among different time steps. Specifically, we visualize the spatial-temporal dependencies captured by the VAR model in Fig. 9. \n\n>>  \"This might be because tests were not performed with commonly used traffic models or the traffic data was in favour for this model\"\nWe do not agree with this comment. We validate our methods on two real-world datasets and have observed consistent improvements. We compared the proposed model with ARIMA, historical average, SVR, VAR, FNN and LSTM based method, which are widely used for traffic forecasting [6, 7, 8].\nBesides, the datasets we used come from Los Angeles and the Bay Area/San Francisco, with different traffic patterns. These datasets are fair representatives for traffic prediction. In addition, we want to emphasize that the traffic sensors were not cherry-picked in our experiments. We simply chose an area and performed experiments on all the working sensors in that area.

The defined diffusion convolution operation is essentially conducting random walks over the road segment graph. To avoid the expensive matrix operation for the random walk, it empirically shows that K = 3 hops of the random walk can give a good performance. The outputs of the graph convolutionary operation are then fed into the sequence to sequence architecture with the GRU cell to model the temporal dependency. Experiments show that the proposed architecture can achieve good performance compared to classic time series baselines and several simplified variants of the proposed model. \n\nAlthough the paper argues that several existing deep-learning based approaches may not be directly applied in the current setting either due to using Euclidean distance or undirected graph structure, the comparisons are not persuasive. For example, the approach in the paper \"DeepTransport: Learning Spatial-Temporal Dependency for Traffic Condition Forecasting\" also consider directed graph and a diffusion effect from 2 or 3 hops away in the neighboring subgraph of a target road segment. \n\nFurthermore, the paper proposes to use two convolution components in Equation 2, each of which corresponds to out-degree and in-degree direction, respectively. This effectively increase the number of model parameters to learn. Compared to the existing spectral graph convolution approach, it is still not clear how its performance will be by using the same number of parameters.
