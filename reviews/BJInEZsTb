We really appreciate your quick response.\n\nWe do agree with the statement that “if you use your generative models for show/display then you want them to be as high-resolution as possible”. \n\nHowever,  we do not propose the use of point-clouds for rendering/displaying geometry at the end of a pipeline.\n\nAs the reviewer likely knows, the ML community has only very recently started to appreciate the best applications for generative models. For example, we have seen in the literature generative models that conjure up synthetic faces of non-existent people - a task which by itself does not seem inherently useful. However, the generated faces are useful: they are being used to create more training data, for example. Even more recently, researchers have proposed the inversion of GANs as a way to ‘walk along the data manifold’ or project on it [1]. This approach is extremely powerful as it allows for eg. completing missing data, finding nearest neighbors etc. Following the same logic, our synthesized pointclouds could add very useful functionality right at the acquisition stage of a 3D system even if the data is never meant for display.\n\nAnother important point we want to make is that a significant part of our novelty lies in the latent representations we were able to learn; which actually are a very effective way to work with 3D objects directly at acquisition (as we demo with shape-analogies, smooth interpolations, part-editing and classification.). These representations are an independent component of our work, not relying on the synthesis part which was only shown to benefit from them.\n\nRegarding strictly the low-resolution of our point-clouds, we want to mention that there are established ways to efficiently increase the resolution of point-clouds (kd-trees) however most applications of point clouds we are aware of, do not improve by the higher density [2]. \n\nIn summary:\nWe argue that generative models are most useful as parts of a bigger pipeline, cases where the samples are not meant to be seen. This is especially true for point-clouds. This makes our work on generative models meaningful, even for medium-resolution samples.\nWe note that our contributions in this study are only partially about the generative model. Most of our work went into learning powerful and efficient representations, capable of semantic operations and very successful classification.\n\n[1] Compressed Sensing using Generative Models\nAshish Bora, Ajil Jalal, Eric Price, Alexandros G.

There are documented reasons why meshes and voxels are preferable for some tasks (eg. visualization/rendering for the former, euclidean space manipulation/shape merging and splitting for the latter) and very clear reasons why point-clouds are preferable for other tasks (simplicity, compactness as an on-surface representation, direct acquisition through sensing devices). This kind of comparison has been performed in various contexts, for various tasks, in the literature of the graphics/geometry processing communities. Thus, deciding on one representation over the other is outside the scope of our work. Point-clouds are a well-understood representation and have an established role in computational geometry, with many well-established algorithms and methods. From a machine learning perspective, this motivates the need for efficient and powerful representations for point-clouds. Having achieved exactly that, we believe that our work is well motivated and its contribution stands on its own.\n\nWe are sorry if we did not make this clear; we commit to adding a prominent explanation in our introduction explaining that:\n\n‘We do not provide a full assessment of the relative merits of different 3D modalities. There are tasks where point-clouds are not the desired modality’,\n\n‘We focus our work on providing powerful and efficient representations for point-clouds’ \n\nFurthermore, we also believe we are making important contributions in the methodology of learning and evaluating generative models. Evaluating GANs is a very hard open problem. Our proposed metric of coverage is an important measurement tool in evaluating mode collapse.\n\nHaving made our main point, we would like to elaborate on some further points of our rebuttal:\n\n1)  How many bytes are required for different representations.\nOur current point-set representation with 2048 points uses 2048x3x4 = 24576 bytes. Our statement was that *if* we were to use a memory bandwidth comparable to that required by Tatarchenko's 128^3 octtree (389200 bytes) we would be able to use 32433 points (instead of 2048) to represent our shapes. This would correspond to a 15x increase in visual resolution of our ground-truth data over what is currently shown. Conversely, if we were to use 24576 bytes for an octree representation, the resolution we would be able to achieve would be significantly lower than 64^3 -- in fact it would be closer to the byte requirement for 32^3. Our statement was only meant to highlight the *compactness* of the point-cloud representation (detail that can be achieved within a given bandwidth) over volumes, including oct-trees.\n\n2) New material.\nWe would like to point the reviewer to the new material we added to our manuscript in response to their question. To the best of our knowledge the state of the art for 3D generative models is Wu et al. Even though it is not the main point we are making with our work, in our revision we included more comparisons (more classes and metrics) with them, clearly indicating our better performance in the point-cloud modality. Following your recommendation we created a new section [Appendix: G] where we included comparisons with other voxel-based methods. Concretely, we demonstrated that by training the generators inside the latent space of a 64^3 voxel-based AE we can improve significantly compared to Wu et al. who also works with 64^3 voxels but in the “raw” space.\n\nTo summarize our main point: the main focus of this work as stated is the study of architectures amenable to representation learning and generation of 3D point-clouds. To be as complete as possible, we included comparisons to some existing 3D voxel-based approaches which measurably improved the SoA on specific tasks (both in MMD/COV and SVM-classification). However, the different 3D modalities are not interchangeable. Point-clouds serve a very important role in 3D pipelines and as such the study of representations and generative models for them is very well motivated. \n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Learning Representations and Generative Models for 3D Point Clouds","abstract":"Three-dimensional geometric data offer an excellent domain for studying representation learning and generative modeling.

We will include following additions to the revision: \n\nA) Evaluation of the MMD/COV metrics in comparison to Wu et al. on all shape categories (in addition to chairs which are already included). \n\nB) Preliminary results with an AE that fully operates on voxel grids. We are experimenting with a voxel-based, fully-convolutional AE that replicates state-of-the art reconstruction results at 32^3 and 64^3 grid resolutions.  Given these AEs, we use the latent-GAN / GMM models to generate voxel grids, which we can then compare to our results. Note that in order to do this comparison using our metrics, we need to convert the voxel-based representations into point clouds in post-processing. Comparing these results against the GANs of Wu et al. that operate directly on the voxel grids can establish whether the performance advantages of the latent-GANs over “vanilla” voxel-based GANs are still prevalent.\n\nBased on our new experiments with these voxel-based models we have observed that \n\n1) Voxel-based approaches (including Wu et al.) are sensitive to the value of the threshold used to produce the final binary occupancy grid from the continuous probability function that the network outputs. Finding an optimal threshold value that works across shapes is not straightforward. As such, these methods tend to produce a lot of shapes with various “blocky” artifacts and disconnected or missing components (for an example see https://www.dropbox.com/s/bkq53j2bx6fet5h/thresholds.png?dl=0 ). This greatly affects the visual quality of the results as well as any quantitative metric. Our generated point clouds do not suffer from such artifacts - they occasionally smear out shape details but we have never observed partial shapes as outputs.\n\n2) A table of our metrics evaluated on the voxel-based methods can be found here : https://www.dropbox.com/s/91x9vwcybxxvkdt/quantitative-volumetric.png?dl=0 . Following observations can be made:  \n2a) We note that the performance of the 64^3 voxel-based GMM is comparable to the one operating at 32^3 resolution. This suggests that the main factor affecting fidelity of the results is not the lack of high-frequency details in the ground-truth data. Thus, it seems unlikely that increasing the resolution to eg. 128^3 would produce more faithful generative results in practice.\n2b) The latent, AE-based GMM models outperform Wu et al.’s “vanilla” GAN architecture, by a big margin, indicating an advantage of using latent representations for generation in this case as well.\n2c) Our point-cloud-based models outperform voxel-based models in terms of the faithfulness of their output to the ground truth, as measured by MMD.\n2d) Voxel-based models seemingly outperform point-clouds ones in terms of coverage. This is likely due to the fact that in computing the coverage metric, one matches *all* generated shapes against the ground truth, regardless of the quality of the generated shape. Voxel-based models occasionally produce partial shapes with missing components due to thresholding artifacts (e.g. https://www.dropbox.com/s/pvo36wcum02sglp/voxel-partial.png?dl=0);  even extremely partial instances (“outliers”) will be matched (however poorly) to an arbitrary ground truth model. This effect likely artificially increases the coverage. \nThe following histogram https://www.dropbox.com/s/pvawf1aym3b9gbj/histogram.png?dl=0 shows distances between the GMM-generated samples and their closest matches in the ground truth. The heavier “tail” for the voxel-based method indicates the presence of such poor quality matchings. Qualitative inspection of the ground truth models that were covered by the voxel-based output but not by the point-cloud output confirmed that the covering came mostly from poor quality partial shapes. Removing such outliers from the coverage calculation brings the coverage of voxel-based GMMs to levels equivalent to those achieved by our point cloud models. \nThis phenomenon highlights a limitation of the coverage metric, namely that it is oblivious to poor matches. Recall, however, that the coverage metric was introduced to complement the MMD metric, which is tailored to detect poor quality output but cannot detect mode collapse."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Learning Representations and Generative Models for 3D Point Clouds","abstract":"Three-dimensional geometric data offer an excellent domain for studying representation learning and generative modeling.

We start by pointing out that the primary goal of our work is not to evaluate different 3D modalities. Our stated goal and main focus has been to learn meaningful representations and generative models for point clouds. As a testament to the power of our learned representations, we also reported that they can be used to improve the state of the art in classification (over existing voxel based methods). A full evaluation of different 3D modalities is highly task dependent; we can definitely envision certain tasks where voxels are a good choice. We chose point clouds because we believe that they are relatively unexplored, concise  and natural input modality which appears as the direct output of most 3D range sensing pipelines.\n\nWith reference to oct-trees specifically, we agree that the oct-tree-based approach is a powerful one, with the potential to achieve high-resolution results (e.g. Tatarchenko et al.). When occupancy grids are the modality of choice, opting for oct-tree cells as opposed to uniformly sized voxels offers an obvious advantage in terms of the resolution that can be captured within a given memory/space bandwidth. Point clouds are a completely distinct, surface-based representation; it only describes the visible part of a shape, which typically is the only relevant part. As such, compared to volumetric representations (occupancy cells of any kind),  point clouds are typically much more compact. \n\nFrom a quantitative perspective, the average oct-tree from the Shapenet car category (as per Tatarchenko et al.) requires 389200 bytes to be stored - within this space bandwidth, we could represent the same shape with a point cloud of 32433 points. This would achieve a very high on-surface resolution (15x what is currently shown in our paper), exceeding what 128^3 cells can achieve. We will add such insights in the paper revision and demonstrate visually. Point clouds can be made even more compact by utilizing data-structures such as kd-trees (https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01222), which could be considered the equivalent, for point clouds, of what oct-trees are for volumetric representations. Exploring this direction for this modality remains an interesting avenue for future work. \n\nThat being said, we strongly agree that further exploring the volumetric modality for generation is an interesting direction for study, and we thank you for the pointer. To address this, we have added new comparisons against standard voxel-based methods; we report related observations in a separate message above.

We will incorporate your exposition/text restructuring suggestions in the next revision - below we address the comments pertaining to the technical part of the paper.\n\nA) Evaluation of metrics on models that memorize/randomly sample\nTo answer this, we randomly sampled the training set, creating sample sets of 3 different sizes, and evaluated our metrics between these ”memorized” sets and our test set; see https://www.dropbox.com/s/gouvyw1vccqxdkb/memorization-table.png?dl=0 . The coverage/fidelity obtained by our generative models is slightly lower than the equivalent in size (case (b) ), as expected: memorizing the training set produces good coverage/fidelity with respect to the test set when they are both drawn from the same population. This speaks for the validity of our metrics. Naturally, the advantage of using a learned representation lies in learning the structure of the underlying space instead of individual samples, which enables compactly representing the data and generating novel shapes as demonstrated by our interpolations.\n\nB) Comparison to voxel-based approaches\nSince comparing to voxel-based methods was a shared concern, we performed extensive comparisons, which we report in a separate message above.  Please let us know if these experiments suffice, or of any additional experiments you might have in mind that would better address this question. Please note that fully studying latent representations on the voxel modality remains beyond the scope of our work, since point clouds are a distinct representation from voxel grids, with its own set of merits. More details on this can be found in our reply to Rev. #3.\n\nC) rGAN performance\nIndeed, designing significantly better raw GANs directly on point clouds requires further study - we do not claim to have shown that building a point-cloud rGAN with performance en par with (or better than) an lGAN is infeasible. Nevertheless, the fact that our latent representations lead to powerful generation is an interesting and novel result on its own.\n\nD) Simplicity of network architectures\nWhile this is true, we do not believe is necessarily constitutes a disadvantage of our networks, especially when considering ease of training and reproducibility. Architectures of similar spirit have been shown to work well with point data in the recent literature (PointNet etc.). Our simple models provide a competitive baseline for point cloud learning that establishes the state of the art.\n\nE) Success of latent-space models (including GMMs) in other domains\nThis is very much an open question and a great research problem. We cannot assert that latent space models are the way to achieve state-of-the-art results in other problems; follow-up work that explores when this might be the case would be very interesting.  Arguably a big challenge on generative models currently lies in evaluating quality and diversity of their produced samples. Our fidelity and coverage metrics contribute to this evaluation discussion.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Learning Representations and Generative Models for 3D Point Clouds","abstract":"Three-dimensional geometric data offer an excellent domain for studying representation learning and generative modeling.

First, they train an auto-encoder for 3D point clouds,  somewhat similar to PointNet (by Qi et al.). Then, they train generative models over the auto-encoder's latent space, both using a \"latent-space GAN\" (l-GAN) that outputs latent codes, and a Gaussian Mixture Model. To generate point clouds, they sample a latent code and pass it to the decoder. They also introduce a \"raw point cloud GAN\" (r-GAN) that, instead of generating a latent code, directly produces a point cloud.\n\nThey evaluate the methods on several metrics. First, they show that the autoencoder's latent space is a good representation for classification problems, using the ModelNet dataset. Second, they evaluate the generative model on several metrics (such as Jensen-Shannon Divergence) and study the benefits and drawbacks of these metrics, and suggest that one-to-one mapping metrics such as earth mover's distance are desirable over Chamfer distance. Methods such as the r-GAN score well on the latter by over-representing parts of an object that are likely to be filled.\n\nPros:\n\n- It is interesting that the latent space models are most successful, including the relatively simple GMM-based model. Is there a reason that these models have not been as successful in other domains?\n\n- The comparison of the evaluation metrics could be useful for future work on evaluating point cloud GANs. Due to the simplicity of the method, this paper could be a useful baseline for future work.\n\n- The part-editing and shape analogies results are interesting, and it would be nice to see these expanded in the main paper.\n\nCons:\n\n- How does a model that simply memorizes (and randomly samples) the training set compare to the auto-encoder-based models on the proposed metrics? How does the diversity of these two models differ?\n\n- The paper simultaneously proposes methods for generating point clouds, and for evaluating them. The paper could therefore be improved by expanding the section comparing to prior, voxel-based 3D methods, particularly in terms of the diversity of the outputs. Although the performance on automated metrics is encouraging, it is hard to conclude much about under what circumstances one representation or model is better than another.\n\n- The technical approach is not particularly novel. The auto-encoder performs fairly well, but it is just a series of MLP layers that output a Nx3 matrix representing the point cloud, trained to optimize EMD or Chamfer distance. The most successful generative models are based on sampling values in the auto-encoder's latent space using simple models (a two-layer MLP or a GMM).\n\n- While it is interesting that the latent space models seem to outperform the r-GAN, this may be due to the relatively poor performance of r-GAN than to good performance of the latent space models, and directly training a GAN on point clouds remains an important problem.\n\n- The paper could possibly be clearer by integrating more of the \"background\" section into later sections. Some of the GAN figures could also benefit from having captions.\n\nOverall, I think that this paper could serve as a useful baseline for generating point clouds, but I am not sure that the contribution is significant enough for acceptance.\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Learning Representations and Generative Models for 3D Point Clouds","abstract":"Three-dimensional geometric data offer an excellent domain for studying representation learning and generative modeling.
