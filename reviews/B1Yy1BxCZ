The most useful part of the paper is the empirical evidence to\nbackup this claim, which I can't easily find in previous literature. I wish\nthe paper had explored a wider variety of dataset tasks and models to better\nshow how well this claim generalizes, better situated the practical benefits\nof the approach (how much wallclock time is actually saved? how well can it be\nintegrated into a distributed workflow?), and included some comparisons with\nother recent recommended ways to increase batch size over time.\n\n\n## Pros / Strengths\n\n+ effort to assess momentum / Adam / other modern methods\n\n+ effort to compare to previous experimental setups\n\n\n## Cons / Limitations\n\n- lack of wallclock measurements in experiments\n\n- only ~2 models / datasets examined, so difficult to assess generalization\n\n- lack of discussion about distributed/asynchronous SGD\n\n\n## Significance\n\nMany recent previous efforts have looked at the importance of batch sizes\nduring training, so topic is relevant to the community. Smith and Le (2017)\npresent a differential equation model for the scale of gradients in SGD,\nfinding a linear scaling rule proportional to eps N/B, where eps = learning\nrate, N = training set size, and B = batch size. Goyal et al (2017) show how\nto train deep models on ImageNet effectively with large (but fixed) batch\nsizes by using a linear scaling rule.\n\nA few recent works have directly tested increasing batch sizes during\ntraining. De et al (AISTATS 2017) have a method for gradually increasing batch\nsizes, as do Friedlander and Schmidt (2012). Thus, it is already reasonable to\npractitioners that the proposed linear scaling of batch sizes during training\nwould be effective.\n\nWhile increasing batch size at the proposed linear scale is simple and seems\nto be effective, a careful reader will be curious how much more could be\ngained from the backtracking line search method proposed in De et al.\n\n\n## Quality\n\nOverall, only single training runs from a random initialization are used. It\nwould be better to take the best of many runs or to somehow show error bars,\nto avoid the reader wondering whether gains are due to changes in algorithm or\nto poor exploration due to bad initialization. This happens a lot in Sec. 5.2.\n\nSome of the experimental setting seem a bit haphazard and not very systematic.\nIn Sec. 5.2, only two learning rate scales are tested (0.1 and 0.5). Why not\nexamine a more thorough range of values?\n\nWhy not report actual wallclock times? Of course having reduced number of\nparameter updates is useful, but it's difficult to tell how big of a win this\ncould be.\n\nWhat about distributed SGD or asyncronous SGD (hogwild)? Small batch sizes\nsometimes make it easier for many machines to be working simultaneously. If we\nscale up to batch sizes of ~ N/10, we can only get 10x speedups in\nparallelization (in terms of number of parameter updates). I think there is\nsome subtle but important discussion needed on how this framework fits into\nmodern distributed systems for SGD.\n\n\n## Clarity\n\nOverall the paper reads reasonably well.\n\nOffering a related work \"feature matrix\" that helps readers keep track of how\nprevious efforts scale learning rates or minibatch sizes for specific\nexperiments could be valueable. Right now, lots of this information is just\nprovided in text, so it's not easy to make head-to-head comparisons.\n\nSeveral figure captions should be updated to clarify which model and dataset\nare studied. For example, when skimming Fig. 3's caption there is no such\ninformation.\n\n## Paper Summary\n\nThe paper examines the influence of batch size on the behavior of stochastic\ngradient descent to minimize cost functions. The central thesis is that\ninstead of the \"conventional wisdom\" to fix the batch size during training and\ndecay the learning rate, it is equally effective (in terms of training/test\nerror reached) to gradually increase batch size during training while fixing\nthe learning rate. These two strategies are thus \"equivalent\". Furthermore,\nusing larger batches means fewer parameter updates per epoch, so training is\npotentially much faster.\n\nSection 2 motivates the suggested linear scaling using previous SGD analysis\nfrom Smith and Le (2017). Section 3 makes connections to previous work on\nfinding optimal batch sizes to close the generaization gap. Section 4 extends\nanalysis to include SGD methods with momentum.\n\nIn Section 5.1, experiments training a 16-4 ResNet on CIFAR-10 compare three\npossible SGD schedules: * increasing batch size * decaying learning rate *\nhybrid (increasing batch size and decaying learning rate) Fig. 2, 3 and 4 show\nthat across a range of SGD variants (+/- momentum, etc) these three schedules\nhave similar error vs. epoch curves. This is the core claimed contribution:\nempirical evidence that these strategies are \"equivalent\".\n\nIn Section 5.3, experiments look at Inception-ResNet-V2 on ImageNet, showing\nthe proposed approach can reach comparable accuracies to previous work at even\nfewer parameter updates (2500 here, vs. ∼14000 for Goyal et al 2007)\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Don't Decay the Learning Rate, Increase the Batch Size","abstract":"It is common practice to decay the learning rate.

This has the advantage that the training process can be better parallelized, allowing for faster training if hundreds of GPUs are available for a short time. The theory part of the paper briefly reviews the relationship between learning rate, batch size, momentum coefficient, and the noise scale in stochastic gradient descent. In the experimental part, it is shown that the loss function and test accuracy depend only on the schedule of the decaying noise scale over training time, and are independent of whether this decaying noise schedule is achieved by a decaying learning rate or an increasing batch size. It is shown that simultaneously increasing the momentum parameter and the batch size also allows for fewer parameters, albeit at the price of some loss in performance.\n\nCOMMENTS:\n\nThe paper presents a simple observation that seems very relevant especially as computing resources are becoming increasingly available for rent on short time scales. The observation is explained well and substantiated by clear experimental evidence. The main issue I have is with the part about momentum. The paragraph below Eq. 7 provides a possible explanation for the performance drop when $m$ is increased. It is stated that at the beginning of the training, or after increasing the batch size, the magnitude of parameter updates is suppressed because $A$ has to accumulate gradient signals over a time scale $B/(N(1-m))$. The conclusion in the paper is that training at high momentum requires additional training epochs before $A$ reaches its equilibrium value. This effect is well known, but it can easily be remedied. For example, the update equations in Adam were specifically designed to correct for this effect. The mechanism is called \"bias-corrected moment estimate\" in the Adam paper, arXiv:1412.6980. The correction requires only two extra multiplications per model parameter and update step. Couldn't the same or a very similar trick be used to correctly rescale $A$ every time one increases the batch size? It would be great to see the equivalent of Figure 7 with correctly rescaled $A$.\n\nMinor issues:\n* The last paragraph of Section 5 refers to a figure 8, which appears to be missing.\n* In Eqs. 4 & 5, the momentum parameter $m$ is not yet defined (it will be defined in Eqs. 6 & 7 below).\n* It appears that a minus sign is missing in Eq. 7. The update steps describe gradient ascent.\n* Figure 3 suggests that most of the time between the first and second change of the noise scale (approx. epochs 60 to 120) are spent on overfitting. This suggests that the number of updates in this segment was chosen unnecessarily large to begin with. It is therefore not surprising that reducing the number of updates does not deteriorate the test set accuracy.\n* It would be interesting to see a version of figure 5 where the horizontal axis is the number of epochs. While reducing the number of updates allows for faster training if a large number of parallel hardware instances are available, the total cost of training is still governed by the number of training epochs.\n* It appears like the beginning of the second paragraph in Section 5.2 describes figure 1. Is this correct?","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Don't Decay the Learning Rate, Increase the Batch Size","abstract":"It is common practice to decay the learning rate.

They've done similar work but in a self-adaptive way. Specifically, it proposed a method to dynamically select the batch size for each update so that it may achieve lower training loss after scanning the same amount of training data. However, its batch adaptive method requires more computation costs to decide a proper batch size.
