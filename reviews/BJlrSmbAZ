The authors compare this approach to\nMonte Carlo dropout (another regularization technique which can also be\nconsidered to perform approximate Bayesian inference). The experiments\nperformed show that the Bayesian view of batch normalization performs similarly\nas MC dropout in terms of the estimates of uncertainty that it produces.\n\nQuality:\n\nI found the quality to be low in some aspects. First, the description of what\nis the prior used by batch normalization in section 3.3 is unsatisfactory. The\nauthors basically refer to Appendix 6.4 for the case in which the weight decay\npenalty is not zero. The details in that Appendix are almost none, they just\nsay \"it is thus possible to derive the prior...\".\n\nThe results in Table 2 are a bit confusing. The authors should highlight in\nbold face the results of the best performing method.\n\nThe authors indicate that they do not need to compare to variational methods\nbecause Gal and Ghahramani 2015 compare already to those methods. However, Gal\nand Ghahramani's code used Bayesian optimization methods to tune\nhyper-parameters and this code contains a bug that optimizes hyper-parameters\nby maximizing performance on the test data. In particular for hyperparameter\nselection, they average performance across (subsets of) 5 of the training sets\nfrom the 20x train/test split, and then using the tau which got the best\naverage performance for all of 20x train/test splits to evaluate performance:\n\nhttps://github.com/yaringal/DropoutUncertaintyExps/blob/master/bostonHousing/net/experiment_BO.py#L54\n\nTherefore, the claim that \n\n\"Since we have established that MCBN performs on par with MCDO, by proxy we\nmight conclude that MCBN outperforms those VI methods as well.\"\n\nis not valid.\n\nAt the beginning of section 4.3 the authors indicate that they follow in their\nexperiments the setup of Gal and Ghahramani (2015).

This is the first time that a Bayesian\ninterpretation has been given to the batch normalization regularization\nproposal.\n\nSignificance:\n\nThe paper's contributions are significant. Batch normalization is a very\npopular regularization technique and showing that it can be used to obtain\nestimates of uncertainty is relevant and significant.

The stochasticity of the prediction comes from different minibatches of training data that were used to normalise the activity/pre-activation values at each layer. This is justified by an argument that using batch norm is doing variational inference, so one should use the approximate posterior provided by batch norm at prediction time. Several experiments show Monte Carlo prediction at test time using batch norm is better than dropout.\n\n*Originality and significance*\n\nAs far as I understand, almost learning algorithms similar to equation 2 can be recast as variational inference under equation 1. However, the critical questions are what is the corresponding prior, what is the approximating density, what are the additional approximations to obtain 2, and whether the approximation is a good approximation for getting closer to the posterior/obtain better prediction. \n\nIt is not clear to me from the presentation what the q(w) density is -- whether this is explicit (as in vanilla Gaussian VI or MC dropout), or implicit (the stochasticity on the activity h due to batch norm induces an equivalence q on w).\n\nFrom a Bayesian perspective, it is also not satisfying to ignore the regularisation term by an empirical heuristic provided in the batch norm paper [small \\lambda] -- what is the rationale of this? Can this be explained by comparing the variational free-energy. \n\nThe experiments also do not compare to modern variational inference methods using the reparameterisation trick with Gaussian variational approximations (see Blundell et al 2016) or richer variational families (see e.g. Louizos and Welling, 2016, 2017). The VI method included in the PBP paper (Hernandez-Lobato and Adams, 2015) does not use the reparameterisation trick, which has been found to reduce variance and improve over Graves' VI method.\n\n*Clarity*\nThe paper is in general well written and easy to understand. \n\n*Additional comments*\n\nPage 2: Monte Carlo Droput --> Dropout\nPage 3 related work: (Adams, 2015) should be (Hernandez-Lobato and Adams, 2015)","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Bayesian Uncertainty Estimation for Batch Normalized Deep Networks","abstract":"Deep neural networks have led to a series of breakthroughs, dramatically improving the state-of-the-art in many domains.

Although the overall presentation is clean, there are few key shortfalls (see below). Overall, the reported functionality is nice, although the experimental results are difficult to intepret (despite laudable effort by the authors to make them intuitive).\n\nSome open questions that I find crucial:\n\n* How exactly is the “stochastic forward-pass” performed that gives rise to the moment estimates? This step is the real meat of the paper, yet I struggle to find a concrete definition in the text. Is this really just an average over a few recent weights during optimization? If so, how is this method specific to batch normalization? Maybe I’m showing my own lack of understanding here, but it’s worrying that the actual sampling technique is not explained anywhere. This relates to a larger point about the paper's main point: What, exactly, is the Bayesian interpretation of batch normalization proposed here? In Bayesian Dropout, there is an explicit variational objective. Here, this is replaced by an implicit regularizer. The argument in Section 3.3 seems rather weak to me. To paraphrase it: If the prior vanishes, so does the regularizer. Fine. But what's the regularizer that's vanishing? The sentence that \"the influence of the prior diminishes as the size of the training data increases\" is debatable for something as over-parametrized as a DNN. I wouldn't be surprised that there are many directions in the weight-space of a trained DNN along which the posterior is dominated by the prior.\n\n* I’m confused about the statements made about the “constant uncertainty” baseline. First off, how is this (constant) width of the predictive region chosen? Did I miss this, or is it not explained anywhere? Unless I misunderstand the definition of CRPS and PLL, that width should matter, no? Then, the paragraph at the end of page 8 is worrying: The authors essentially say that the constant baseline is quite close to the estimate constructed in their work because constant uncertainty is “quite a reasonable baseline”. That can hardly be true (if it is, then it puts the entire paper into question! If trivial uncertainty is almost as good as this method, isn't the method trivial, too?). \nOn a related point: What would Figure 2 look like for the constand uncertainty setting? Just a horizontal line in blue and red? But at which level?\n\nI like this paper. It is presented well (modulo the above problems), and it makes some strong points. But I’m worried about the empirical evaluation, and the omission of crucial algorithmic details. They may hide serious problems.","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Bayesian Uncertainty Estimation for Batch Normalized Deep Networks","abstract":"Deep neural networks have led to a series of breakthroughs, dramatically improving the state-of-the-art in many domains.
