Recent development of machine learning methods in medical imaging have provided doctors with a complementary set of tools to tackle these issues. \nHowever, existing CNN architectures may not be optimal for specialized medical tasks such as cancer nodule classification. Thus, the authors propose a new architecture and compare it to AlexNet, an existing architecture.\n\nAs such, we seek verify the claims by the original authors which state that the proposed CNN architecture classifies cancer nodes at an accuracy of 99.79 and that false positive rates are reduced to less than 0.01%.\n\nThe dataset utilized, as outlined by the original authors are derived from the LUNA2016 dataset, part of the LIDC/IDRI database. We were able to obtain the 888 scans, along with the annotations, and are fairly confident that this is the same data set the authors used. However, the authors did not provide sufficient information in order to perform the preprocessing of the raw images. Therefore, our team followed LUNA2016's tutorials which explain the procedure to convert relevant sections of the medical images into either PNG format. We assumed that the authors followed the same method as in the tutorial.\n\nIn order to reproduce the authors' results, we constructed a network following the proposed architecture from their paper. In this respect, the authors provided very clear and concise  instructions about the architecture of their CNN. Our CNN was implemented using Keras with TensorFlow backend instead of MATLAB, as we assume the authors used. Every layer of our network follows the description of the authors' network, with the exception of the fully-connected layers due to the lack of specifications. Thus, our architecture contains 7 convolutional layers, along with their associated padding, pooling and dropout layers. The authors did not specify the number of dense layers at the end of their convolutional layers, nor the activation functions for the dense layers. Thus, we opted for flattening the convolutional layer, and connecting it to two fully-connected layers. Due to the output being binary, a Sigmoid activation function with binary cross-entropy loss function. It is also worth noting that the figure provided in the original paper differs from the architecture presented. We followed the written architecture instead of the graphical one. The model was then trained on an NVidia GTX970 GPU, which is less powerful than the four NVidia GTX1080 which the authors used. The authors clearly stated the time requirements for training their networks.\n\nThe original paper provides an extensive validation table. However, the procedures were unclear as our team could not understand how exactly the authors obtained their validation results. Thus, we decided to work with the subsets contained in the data set. On the 10 total subsets, we performed 7-fold cross validation, using 6 subsets as training sets, 1 subset as validation set each time, and withholding 3 subsets for a final test set. Our results turned out similar to the ones in the paper. However, in addition, we propose a baseline consisting of predicting all tumors as benign. Such a baseline performs significantly better than a random baseline, and due to class imbalance in the data set, it provides a comparable accuracy to the CNN's.\n\nAs a final note, the authors' paper contains sections which are well-described and detailed such as the architecture of their proposed model. However, other sections may be lacking in clarity and could be ambiguous, notably in their description of validation procedures. Moreover, there are discrepancies between the architecture of the proposed CNN and the figure showing the graphical model. Minor typos and mistakes include the extension of the data set, which is \".MHD\", not \".MDH\", and the confusion of FPR and FNR in the explanations for the evalutation metrics.\n\nOverall, the authors' approach to the classification of tumors was interesting, and we would have liked to reproduce the authors' results more faithfully if the code behind the results was provided.\n\nOur full review is located at: https://github.com/ExTee/COMP551-Final"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Lung Tumor Location and Identification with AlexNet and a Custom CNN","abstract":"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the world and early detection is a crucial part of increasing patient survival.

The publicly available and well-labeled dataset that the paper uses is the modified LIDC-IDRI dataset that\ncontains sets of CT scans of patients with lung tumours. The size of the dataset is 128GB of DICOM images, and is 32GB\nwhen converted to PNG. Manipulation of this data was difficult and time consuming on its own.\nThe authors obtained their input and output sets from the closed Luna 2016 Challenge, which came in a preprocessed format\nand also came divided into 10 different subsets. We did not have access to the Luna 2016 Challenge dataset (no public access),\nso we ended up using the publicly available LIDC-IDRI dataset and pre-processed it in a way that matched the Luna dataset\ndescription. The authors state that they worked with 888 patients, whereas for our dataset, following the same procedure,\nyielded 896 patients. This discrepancy in input was not so big that we would expect significantly different results. The only\nimplication is that some additional patient files were removed before finalizing the Luna dataset in a manner that was not\ndocumented. Converting the data to PNG files was needed as the original format (DICOM and MDH) contains more than just\nthe pictures of the scans, which we were able to achieve. We also had to extract the output labels from the public dataset\nourselves, which could have also contributed to some differences from the data that the paper uses. Given that the authors of\nthe paper had to convert the pixel labels from millimeters to pixels, we believe the labels provided to the authors differed in\nformat from those supplied with the LIDC-IDRI.\nThe paper implemented two CNN architectures: an AlexNet modified to binary output, and a custom CNN designed by\nthe authors for the purpose of tumour identification. The architecture was described using both figures and a layer-wise text\ndescription, however these descriptions were inconsistent. We used a version that contained all the layers from both architectures,\nwhich adds another uncertainty in the reproduction of the results. The motivation for using the custom CNN was the ability\nto decrease the false positive rates compared to the baseline AlexNet. Ultimately, our findings were unable to support or deny\nthis assertion. In our efforts to trying to run both of these models, the difficulty that we faced (apart from the ambiguity in the\nnetwork architecture) was the lack of proper hardware available to us. We were able to use a NVIDIA Titan X GPU, which\nonly provided 12GB of memory that turned out to be a limiting factor for us as we needed to decrease the resolution of our\ninput images for the custom CNN. We would also like to note the lack of the hyper-parameters identified in the paper of which\nwere used to train the two classifiers."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Lung Tumor Location and Identification with AlexNet and a Custom CNN","abstract":"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the world and early detection is a crucial part of increasing patient survival.

We find the paper\ninteresting in that it focuses on automating Cancer diagnosis from Lung CT scans which would perhaps have real clinical impact on the lives of patients.\n\nThe paper was difficult to reproduce due to missing key information. Code and input data were not included with the\nmanuscript. The software packages used were not always mentioned and software versions were not shared. Computational\nresources needed to run the analysis were also not disclosed. Hyper-parameters of the CNN models were sometimes missing, such as the Random Seed used throughout the analysis, the number of trained epochs for each CNN and the optimizer used to compile the models.\n\nThe authors mention that they split the dataset into 70% training data and 30% test data, however, they did so based on\nCT scans and not based on instances of the labels. This was not described in enough detail to allow proper reproduction. Some\nmore details would have been useful.\n\nThe authors described their CNN structure in great detail; however, there was a mismatch between the description in the\ntext and the figure representing the CNN architecture. Two convolutional layers, steps 12 and 13, were not displayed in the figure.\n\nThe authors mention that they also attempted to localize the tumor across the CT scan and mention using a RCNN,\nhowever, no other details were given and hence this part was difficult to reproduce.\n\nThe authors used an input size of 512 x 512 for their CNN but used 227 x 227 input size for AlexNet. It was not\ndescribed how the transformation was done or whether input data was processed separately at two different sizes for each CNN.\n\nAlmost 80% of the time spent on this challenge was spent on understanding and processing the input data, in order to\nmake it ready to train the CNN. Input data is a fundamental part of Machine Learning and small differences in data processing\nmight result in different datasets and thus different performance by the algorithm. Given the complexity of the dataset and the difficulty in describing all steps in details, it is advisable that the processed data used to train a model be shared in its exact format or that the code that produced the data be made available to avoid small discrepancies.\n\nThe authors have reported an accuracy of about 99.79%, roughly 3% higher than anything reported online to date,\nincluding the scoreboards of the Grand LUNA Challenge and the Kaggle Data Science Bowl 2017. It would be interesting for the authors to submit their results to both of these scoreboards to register their performance.\n\n\n\nNote: We are researchers ourselves and have authored manuscripts which if judged today, would likely have missing\ninformation that would make them hard to reproduce as well. This has been an interesting mental exercise as your readers, but also for us as authors of scientific content. While it might not be fun to go through this task of thinking of reproducibility and what details to include in a manuscript, it certainly is necessary for all of us as researchers to ensure that our work has the highest impact on the scientific community and society as a whole. I hope you appreciate the value of what we are trying to do and not take any comments personally; this is really more of an issue of us as a community and a need to standardize scientific reporting and instigate thought about reproducibility."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Lung Tumor Location and Identification with AlexNet and a Custom CNN","abstract":"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the world and early detection is a crucial part of increasing patient survival.
