This is because often it will be the case that information that is biased is also highly predictive (in fact in the medical setting this is precisely why it is biased - because the doctors will assign treatments based on predictive features). GANITE on the other hand is not forced to make this bias trade-off and so, as shown in Figure 2, is able to outperform methods such as CFR_WASS, particularly when the bias is high.\n\nA further advantage of GANITE is that PEHE can be estimated from the generated counterfactuals of the “G” network.Therefore, we can directly optimize the hyperparameters that minimize the estimated PEHE which is the performance metric for ITE estimation. On the other hand, existing work such as CFR_WASS [1] cannot directly optimize PEHE.\n\n[1] Shalit, Uri, Fredrik Johansson, and David Sontag. \"Estimating individual treatment effect: generalization bounds and algorithms.\" ICML, 2016.\n\nAnswer 2: In the revised manuscript we will show improved results for GANITE on small datasets by searching for hyper-parameters in a larger space.\n\nAnswer 3: The ITE GAN can be replaced by any regression method.

However, this is not the only reason that we use ITE GAN instead of other regression models. The ITE GAN allows us to estimate the distribution of the potential outcomes, rather than just the expectation, which gives us access to, for example, the variance, capturing the underlying variability of the potential outcomes.

This is because we never have access to the true loss function (in our case PEHE or MSE) that we are trying to minimize, and so the difficulty arises about what metric to use to tune hyperparameters with respect to, in the absence of the target loss. One of the advantages of GANITE is that our target loss (PEHE or MSE) can be estimated from the generated counterfactuals, unlike other methods such as in [1]. Therefore, we can directly optimize the hyperparameters that minimize this estimated PEHE/MSE - exact details of our hyper-parameter optimization are given in the Appendix. In the revised manuscript, we will state the optimal values for the hyper-parameters that we found for each dataset using greedy search. \n\n[1] Shalit, Uri, Fredrik Johansson, and David Sontag. \"Estimating individual treatment effect: generalization bounds and algorithms.\" ICML, 2016.\n\nAnswer 2: We think that our explanation in the manuscript may not have been clear to understand. We will break section 4 into two subsections that explain “G” and “I” networks separately. We agree that different treatments will have different outcomes, however, we think the misunderstanding has come from confusing “factual/counterfactual” with different treatment assignments. It should be noted that “factual” and “counterfactual” do not correspond to specific treatments – for any given sample, it is possible that any treatment is the factual one. It therefore makes sense to try and push counterfactual outcomes from one sample toward the factual outcomes from other (similar) samples for the same treatments. We achieve this by making the objective of “G” to generate counterfactuals in a way that, given the whole vector (factuals and counterfactuals), the discriminator cannot distinguish which element is factual.\n\nWe think there may also be some confusion around the “S loss” used for “G”. Due to the structure of “G”, it outputs a full vector of potential outcomes, and so it not only outputs counterfactuals, but also gives a value for the one factual that was used as input. We account for this by using the “S loss” to force the generated outcome for the factual treatment assignment to be close to the factual outcome actual observed. This is because, conditional on observing y_f, the component of y corresponding to y_f should clearly be equal to y_f.\n\nAnswer 3: As can be seen in Answer 1, GANITE generates proxies for the counterfactuals and this allows us to estimate the PEHE directly. We minimized the estimated PEHE over the hyper-parameter space. We will clarify this in the revised paper.\n\nAnswer 4: In the revised manuscript, we will include the optimal hyper-parameters (alpha and beta) that we found (using greedy search) for each dataset.\n\nAnswer 5: The tasks that “G” and “I” perform are fundamentally different. “G” predicts outcomes conditional on features, treatment assignment and outcome of the chosen treatment, (x, t, y_f). “I” predicts outcomes conditional only on the features, x, and so it would be expected for “G” to perform better than “I” when the task is predicting based on (x, t, y_f). This is the only comparison we can make, since “G” is not capable of predicting with only x. Furthermore, “G” and “I” are not at all independent, “I” is trained on a dataset generated by “G” and so “I” is being forced to “fit” to the outcomes “G” has generated. This means that any errors “G” has made in-sample will be pushed forward to “I”.\n\nHowever, the performance gap between the two will indicate how well “I” is able to learn from “G”, which we believe is an interesting question and so we will add results for this comparison in the Appendix of the revised manuscript. \n\nAnswer 6: We did think about this idea. In order to zero out the contribution of “y_f” and “t”, we need to marginalise out the distributions of “y_f” and “t” conditional on “x”, i.e. P(y_f, t | x) because P(y | x) = int P(y | x, y_f, t) P(y_f, t | x). Therefore, in order to zero out “y_f” and “t” we would need to learn P(y_f, t | x). This requires a model to learn and we do not believe this would be any simpler than our proposed structure - in both cases we would still have 2 learning stages.\n\nWe will try this idea (zero out the contribution of “y_f” and “t”) and report the results in the Appendix of the revised manuscript.\n\nAnswer 7: We follow the code published in https://github.com/clinicalml/cfrnet. We followed the parameter search process suggested in the github using cfr_param_search.py. We will clarify this in the revised manuscript.\n\nAnswer 8: We will revise it. Thanks.\n\nAnswer 9: For IHDP, we indeed do 1000 replications and report the results. For other experiments (twins and Jobs), we do 100 replications and report the results.

However, as shown in Table 1, using the ITE GAN does improve the PEHE over using just the Counterfactual GAN (See Row 1 Column 3 of Table 1). On top of this, we believe that there is a further novelty in the ITE GAN - using it allows us to estimate the conditional distribution of the potential outcomes, rather than just the expectation. This allows us to estimate the uncertainty in the true distribution of the outcomes which is important to know when deciding which treatments to assign. We will highlight this point in the revised manuscript.\n\nAnswer 2: Bold is just to highlight the results of our model.

We therefore believe that what is important is its performance in the large datasets where ground truth is often impossible to identify. We will, however, show improvements for GANITE on smaller datasets by searching for hyper-parameters in a larger space.\n\nAnswer 3-3: The problem we address with GANITE is to estimate the ITE. We used the ATE performance as a sanity check for our method - and believe it passes the sanity check, being competitive with most other methods - but do not believe that it is an important metric for distinguishing models where the task is predicting treatment effects on an individual level (and so we only included these results in the Appendix). To highlight why ATE is not a good metric for comparison of ITE methods, we give a simple example. Consider the model that, for each treatment, simply predicts the population mean of the observed outcomes. Then this will often be a highly underfitted model for the task of ITE prediction since there will be many samples that deviate significantly from this mean, however, the ATE will be close to optimal (in this case bias hasn’t actually been accounted for)."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"GANITE: Estimation of Individualized Treatment Effects using Generative Adversarial Nets","abstract":"Estimating individualized treatment effects (ITE) is a challenging task due to the need for an individual's potential outcomes to be learned from biased data and without having access to the counterfactuals.

This is achieved by utilising a GAN to impute the `missing` counterfactuals, i.e. the  outcomes of the treatments that were not observed in the training (i.e. factual) sample, and then using another GAN to estimate the ITE based on this `complete` dataset. The authors then proceed in combining the two GAN objectives with extra supervised losses to better account for the observed data; the GAN loss for the `G` network has an extra term for the `G` network to better predict the factual outcome `y_f` (which should be easy to do given the fact that y_f is an input to the network) and the GAN loss for the `I` network has an extra term w.r.t. the corresponding performance metric used for evaluation, i.e. PEHE for binary treatment and MSE for multiple treatments. This model is then evaluated on extensive experiments.\n\nThe paper is reasonably well-written with clear background and diagrams for the overall architecture. The idea is novel and seems to be relatively effective in practice although I do believe that it has a lot of moving parts and introduces a considerable amount of hyperameters (which generally are problematic to tune in causal inference tasks). Other than that, I have the following questions and remarks:\n- I might have misunderstood the motivation but the GAN objective for the `G` network is a bit weird; why is it a good idea to push the counterfactual outcomes close to the factual outcomes (which is what the GAN objective is aiming for)? Intuitively, I would expect that different treatments should have different outcomes and the distribution of the factual and counterfactual `y` should differ.\n- According to which metric did you perform hyper-parameter optimization on all of the experiments? \n- From the first toy experiment that highlights the importance of each of the losses it seems that the addition of the supervised loss greatly boosts the performance, compared to just using the GAN objectives. What was the relative weighting on those losses in general? \n- From what I understand the `I` network is necessary for out-of-sample predictions where you don’t have the treatment assignment, but for within sample prediction you can also use the `G` network. What is the performance gap between the `I` and `G` networks on the within-sample set? Furthermore, have you experimented with constructing `G` in a way that can represent `I` by just zeroing the contribution of `y_f` and `t`? In this way you can tie the parameters and avoid the two-step process (since `G` and `I` represent similar things).\n- For figure 2 what was the hyper parameters for CFR? CFR includes a specific knob to account for the larger mismatches between treated and control distributions. Did you do hyper-parameter tuning for all of the methods in this task?\n- I would also suggest to not use “between” when referring to the KL-divergence as it is not a symmetric quantity.\n\nAlso it should be pointed out that for IHDP the standard evaluation protocol is 1000 replications (rather than 100) so there might be some discrepancy on the scores due to that.","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"GANITE: Estimation of Individualized Treatment Effects using Generative Adversarial Nets","abstract":"Estimating individualized treatment effects (ITE) is a challenging task due to the need for an individual's potential outcomes to be learned from biased data and without having access to the counterfactuals.

We propose a novel method for inferring ITE based on the Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) framework. Our method, termed Generative Adversarial Nets for inference of Individualized Treatment Effects (GANITE), is motivated by the possibility that we can capture the uncertainty in the counterfactual distributions by attempting to learn them using a GAN. We generate proxies of the counterfactual outcomes using a counterfactual generator, G, and then pass these proxies to an ITE generator, I, in order to train it. By modeling both of these using the GAN framework, we are able to infer based on the factual data, while still accounting for the unseen counterfactuals.
