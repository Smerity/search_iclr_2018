The original WordNet hierarchy is bounded by the depth of 20. In our paper, we take the setup specified in MacCartney (2009) to bound the depth at 8 (i.e., ignoring pairs in the hierarchy which have more than 8 edges in between).  Similarly, we follow MacCartney (2009) for hypernym and hyponym feature design, which we are shown in our experiments to help improve neural-network-based inference model. We will make this clearer in our revision. \n  \n>>> Reviewer’s comment 2:”This only constitutes clear evidence if the proposed model is identical to ESIM in all of its unimportant details—word representations, hyperparameter tuning methods, etc. Can the authors comment on this?”\n \nAuthor response: We are sure that all of its unimportant details, such as hyperparameter tuning methods, are identical to ESIM. We modified the ESIM code from GitHub (https://github.com/lukecq1231/nli) and we only modified NLI components to explore external knowledge. In addition, ESIM is a well-tuned model already and tuning ESIM by itself does not yield further gain.\n \n>>> Reviewer’s comment 3: ”Say more about why you choose equation (9). This notably treats all five relation types equally, which seems like a somewhat extreme simplifying assumption.”\n \nAuthor response: Good comment. We actually added a MLP layer in Theano to learn the underlying combination function but did not actually observe further improvement over our best performance. We will add the results and some discussion in our revision.\n \n>>> Reviewer comments 4: What is \"early stopping with patience of 7\"? Is that meant to mean 7 epochs?\n \nAuthor response: Yes, early stopping with patience of 7 means 7 epochs. We will make this clearer. \n\nIn general, as informal reasoning is a core problem, our SoTa results on one of the widely used benchmarks (SNLI), our investigation of missing knowledge in all three major inference components, as well as the analysis, in our opinion, are nice contributions. If space allows, we will also add and discuss some typical, failed investigations/models we have performed.\n \n[References]\nBill MacCartney. Natural Language Inference.

Incorporating WordNet embedding achieved an accuracy of 88.2% on SNLI, compared with 88.6% with KIM and 88.0% with ESIM. WordNet embedding is trained to be sensitive to some semantic relation (e.g., is-a relation which could help detect entailment) but not on others (semantic relations) that would further help NLI (e.g., word pairs with common parents often help identify contradiction). We will add some discussion along this line.\n \n>>>Reviewer’s comment 3: \"Another avenue of exploration is the integration of more resources ...\"\n \nAuthor response: WordNet is a lexical and common sense resource that naturally encodes entailment and contradiction information as discussed in the paper and above (e.g., “is-a” and “sibling” relation between word pairs can help resolve entailment and contradiction, respectively). Particularly, considering how NLI data is constructed (e.g., SNLI relies on annotators’ common sense to write entailment and contradiction sentences), we think WordNet is a good resource to demonstrate our algorithms which enhances NN-based NLI models on all three typical NLI submodules/subcomponents. Furthermore, we indeed incorporated WikiData (Freebase) and it did not improve model performance (it is not surprising as most of WikiData is about entities and relations (e.g. Bill Gates and Microsoft) which do not correspond to common entailment/contradiction relation (e.g., red/yellow is contradicting). Thank you for the comment, which we think is very constructive. We will add discussion on this in our revision. \n \n[References]\nBill MacCartney. Natural Language Inference.

The ablation studies at the end of the paper are the most compelling part of the argument, more so than achieving SoTa. Having said that, since their studies on performance with a low dataset size are the most interesting part of the paper, I would have liked to see results on smaller datasets like RTE. Additionally, it would be useful to see results on MultiNLI which is more challenging and spans more domains; using world knowledge with MultiNLI would be a good test of their claims and methods. \nI'm also glad that the authors establish statistical significance! I would have liked to see some additional analysis on the kinds of sentences the KIM models succeeds at where their baseline ESIM fails. I think this would be a compelling addition.\n\nPros:-\n- Thorough experimentation with ablation studies; show success of method when using limited training data.\n- Establish statistical significance.\n- Acheive SoTa on SNLI.\n\nCons:-\n- Authors make the broad claim of world knowledge being helpful for textual entailment, and show usefulness in a limited datasize setting, but don't test their method on other datasets RTE (which has a lot less data).

Synonyms, antonyms, and non-synonymous sister terms in the ontology are represented using indicator features. Hyponymy and hypernymy are represented using path length features. These features are used to modify inter sentence attention, the final post-attention word representations, and the pooling operation used to aggregate the final sentence representations prior to inference. All of these three additions help, especially in the low data learning scenario. When all of the SNLI training data is used this approach adds 0.6% accuracy on the SNLI 3-way classification task. \n\nI think that the integration of structured knowledge representations into neural models is a great avenue of investigation. And I'm glad to see that WordNet helps. But very little was done to investigate different ways in which these data can be integrated. The authors mention work on knowledge base embeddings and there has been plenty of work on learning WordNet embeddings. An obvious avenue of exploration would compare the use of these to the use of the indicator features in this paper. Another avenue of exploration is the integration of more resources such as VerbNet, propbank, WikiData etc. An approach that works with all of these would be much more impressive as it would need to handle a much more diverse feature space than the 4 inter-dependent features introduced here.\n\nQuestions for authors:\n\nIs the WordNet hierarchy bounded at a depth of 8?

External knowledge is important to reduce the amount of training material for NLI. When dataset were extremely smaller yet more complex, this fact has been already noticed and reported in many systems. Now, it is extremely important that it is has been started to be true also in NN-based models for NLI/RTE.\n\nHovever, the paper fails in describing the model with respect to the vast body of research in RTE. In fact, alignment is one of the basis for building RTE systems. Attention models are in fact extremely related to alignment and \"KNOWLEDGE-ENRICHED CO-ATTENTION\" is somehow a model that incorporates what has been already extensively used to align word pairs. \nHence, models such as those described in the book \"Recognizing textual entailment\" can be extremely useful in modeling the same features in NN-based models, for example, \"A Phrase-Based Alignment Model for Natural Language Inference\", EMNLP 2008, or \"Measuring the semantic similarity of texts\", 2005 or \"Learning Shallow Semantic Rules for Textual Entailment\", RANLP, 2007.\n\nThe final issue is the validity of the initial claim. Is it really the case that external knowledge is useful? It appears that external knowledge is useful only in the case of restricted data (see Figure 3). Hence, it is unclear whether this is useful for the overall set. One of the important question here is then if the knowledge of all the data is in fact replicating the knowledge of wordnet.

(I'm updating my confidence to a 5.) So, the paper makes an empirically *very* small step in an interesting line of language understanding research. This paper should be published in some form, but my low-ish score is due simply to my worry that ICLR is not the venue. I think this would be a clear 'accept' as a *ACL short paper, and would probably be viable as a *ACL long paper, but it will definitely have less impact on the overall field of representation learning than will the typical ICLR paper, so I can recommend it only with reservations.\n\n--\n\nThis paper presents a method to use external lexical knowledge (word–word relations from WordNet) as an auxiliary input when solving the problem of textual entailment (aka NLI). The idea of accessing outside commonsense knowledge within an end-to-end trained model is one that I expect to be increasingly important in work on language understanding. This paper does not make that much progress on the problem in general—the methods here are quite specific to words and to NLI—and the proposed methods yields only yield large empirical gains in a reduced-data setting, but the paper serves as a well-executed proof of concept. In short, the paper is likely to be of low technical impact, but it's interesting and thorough enough that I lean slightly toward acceptance.\n\nMy only concern is on fair comparison: Numbers from this model are compared with numbers from the published ESIM model in several places (Table 3, Figure 2, etc.) as a way to provide evidence for the paper's core claim (that the added knowledge in the proposed model helps). This only constitutes clear evidence if the proposed model is identical to ESIM in all of its unimportant details—word representations, hyperparameter tuning methods, etc. Can the authors comment on this?\n\nFor what it's worth, the existence of another paper submission on roughly the same topic with roughly the same results (https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B1twdMCab) makes more confident that the main results in this paper are sound, since they've already been replicated, at least to a coarse approximation.\n\nMinor points:\n\nFor TransE, what does this mean:\"However, these kind of approaches usually need to train a knowledge-graph embedding beforehand.\"\n\nYou should say more about why you chose the constant 8 in Table 1 (both why you chose to hard code a value, and why that value).\n\nThere's a mysterious box above the text 'Figure 1'. Possibly a figure rendering error?\n\nThe LSTM equations are quite widely known. I'd encourage you to cite a relevant source and remove them.\n\nSay more about why you choose equation (9). This notably treats all five relation types equally, which seems like a somewhat extreme simplifying assumption.\n\nEquation (15) is confusing. Is a^m a matrix, since it doesn't have an index on it?\n\nWhat is \"early stopping with patience of 7\"? Is that meant to mean 7 epochs?\n\nThe opening paragraph of 5.1 seems entirely irrelevant, as do the associated results in the results table. I suspect that this might be an opportunity for a gratuitous self-citation.\n\nThere are plenty of typos: \"... to make it replicatibility purposes.\"; \"Specifically, we use WordNet to measure the semantic relatedness of the *word* in a pair\"; etc.","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Natural Language Inference with External Knowledge","abstract":"Modeling informal inference in natural language is very challenging.

We ran the proposed models on MultiNLI. With the same setting, on the \"in-domain\" test set, the proposed model, KIM (knowledge-based inference model), achieves an accuracy of 77.4% (vs. 77.0% of the ESIM model (Chen et al. ACL '17)). In addition, on the \"cross-domain\" test set, KIM achieves a 75.8% accuracy (vs. 75.5% of ESIM). We will add these results in our revision. Thanks for the constructive comments, which make the results more comprehensive.\n[References]\nQ. Chen, X. Zhu, Z. Ling, S. Wei, H. Jiang, and D. Inkpen. (2017).
