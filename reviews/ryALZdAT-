However, it only decreases the training loss. How do we know it will not lead to overfitting?\n\nGood question. In our experiments, we don't find the feature incay will lead to overfitting. e.g., by considering feature incay, RN + Softmax decreases the training loss and improves the Softmax from 91.41% to 92.16% on the test set of CIFAR10. It remains an open problem to provide theoretical analysis about whether increasing the feature norm will lead to overfitting currently. \n\n\n-2-  Increasing the feature norm of mis-classified examples will make gradient larger for self-correction. And the manuscript proves it in property 2. However, the proof seems not complete. In Eq (7), increasing the feature norm would also affect the value of the term in parenthesis. As an example, if a negative example is already mis-classified as a positive, and its current probability is very close to 1, then further increasing feature norm would make the probability even closer to 1, leading to saturation and smaller gradient.\n\nThanks for pointing this problem. The proof of property 2 is indeed complete.  In your described case, increasing the feature norm will not lead to smaller gradients for both the weight vectors of the ground truth category and the wrongly predict category , which instead will have larger gradients. \n\nWe give the reasons below. For a mis-classified sample i with ground truth label y_i.  It is true that \"When the mis-classified f_i has probability of class k(k!=y_i) close to 1, then increase the feature norm of f_i will make the probability of class k even closer to 1\", but this will not cause \"saturation and smaller gradient\" for all w_k and w_(y_i).  According to Equation (7):\n\n(1) the gradient of w_(y_i) : when  j=y_i, h(i)=1, P_j^i is close to 0, then (P_j^i-h(i)) is close to -1, so the gradients for the weight vector of ground truth category  can be increased by increasing the norm of f_i; \n(2) the gradient of w_(k): when j=k, h(i)=0, as that P_k^i is close to 1, (P_k^i-h(i)) is close 1, the gradients for weight vector of the wrongly predict category can be increased by increasing the norm of f_i. \n(3) the gradients of other w_j:  when j!=y_i && j!=k ,  (P_j^i-h(i)) is close to 0, thus the gradients is close to zero.\n \n\n\n-3- Figure 1 shows that examples with larger feature norm tend to be predicted well. However, it is not very convincing since it is only a correlation rather than causality. Let's use simple linear softmax regression as a sanity check, where features to softmax are real features rather than hidden units. Increasing the feature norm seems to be against the best practice of feature normalization in which each feature after normalization is of variance 1.\n\nThanks for pointing out this interesting problem.  As we observe that the feature norm and the classification accuracy is positively related,  and we investigate whether increasing the feature norm explicitly could improve the performance and find that the classification accuracy is improved with the feature incay.  It also remains an open problem to provide theoretical analysis about whether  it is correlation or causality currently.\nIncreasing the feature norm is not against the best practice of feature normalization.  In fact, increasing the feature norm before normalization can also help improve the final performance, which is shown in Table 1 and stated in the last sentence of Section 4.2.(\"feature incay can even promote the A-softmax with normalized features by elongating the features before normalization\")\n\n\n\n-4- The manuscript states that the feature norm won't be infinitely increased since there is an upper bound. However, the proof of property 3 seems to only apply to the certain cases where K<2D. In addition, alpha is in the formula of upper bound, but what is the upper bound of alpha?\n\nThanks for pointing out this issue. Our property essentially is not limited to K<2D. We updated Property 3 for both K<2D and K>=2D case: \n\"...(2) to ensure the maximal intra-class distance is smaller than the minimal inter-class distance, the upper bound of feature norm is 3*alpha, especially when K < 2D, the upper bound in a tighter range of [(1 + sqrt(2))*alpha, 3*alpha]\". So 3*alpha is a general upper bound whether K<2D or K>=2D. Especially, when K<2D, we can formulate a tighter range for the upper bound.\n\nWhat's the upper bound of alpha is an interesting problem, but it is not our current interest. The main point of Property 3 lies in that the ratio of the upper bound beta to the lower bound alpha is bounded: beta/alpha <= 3.  \n\n-5- For proof of property 3, it seems that alpha and beta are used before defined. Are they the radius of two circles?\n\nYes, they are the radius of the two circles.

We revised the description and re-plot Figure 3 in the paper to make their relation much clearer and avoid the possible misunderstanding.\n\nWe provide a short explanation below. The purpose of Figure 3 is to show that the mis-classified examples(we can also call them \"hard examples\") tend to be of small feature norm, which has been re-plot based on your advice. Property 2 is proposed to state that we need to increase the feature norm of mis-classified examples(tend to with small feature norm), which makes larger gradient and helps correcting the mis-classified examples.\nEspecially, the fifth column in Table 5 shows that by increasing the feature norm of mis-classified examples, the \"RN + Softmax\" correctly classifies 336 examples that are mis-classified by \"Softmax\".  \n\n-3- The author used reciprocal norm loss which increases feature norm as shown in Figure 4. However, both Figures are not explained in the main text, and thus hard to understand the relation of Figure 3 and 4.\nThanks for pointing out this problem. We now added the explanations in the main text. Figure 4 is used to show the Reciprocal Norm Loss can result in more intra-class compactness by increasing the small feature norm faster than the large ones. Figure 3 is not related to Figure 4, and it is about Property 2. \n \n-4- Large-margin Soft max in Figure 2 is not explained in the introduction section. \nThanks for pointing out this problem. We provided the explanation of Large-margin Softmax loss in the first paragraph of Section 2 (Related work). We will put it to the introduction section if it is necessary.\n\n-5- In Eq.(7), P_j^I is not defined. \nWe have added the definition of P_j^i in Eq.(7) in the updated paper. In fact, we have also defined P_j^i in Property 4.\n\n-6- In the Property 3, The author wrote “ where r is lower bound of feature norm”. However, r is not used.\nThanks for pointing out this problem, which is a typo. \"r\" should be replaced with \"alpha\".\n\n-7- In the experimental results, “RN” is not defined.\n \"RN\" refers to the feature incay with form of Reciprocal Norm. We have added that \"... RN(Reciprocal Norm loss) plus the baseline method. e.g., RN + Softmax means combining the feature incay with Softmax loss.\" in the updated paper.\n\n-8- In the Table 3, the order of \\lambda should be increasing or decreasing order. \nWe have resorted it in decreasing order.\n\n-9- Table 5 is not referred in the main text. \nThanks for pointing out this problem.
