The idea is that the threshold effects of discretization make it harder to find adversarial examples that only make small alterations of the image, but also that it introduces more non-linearities, which might increase robustness. In addition, discretization has little negative impact on the performance on clean data. The authors also propose a version of single-step or multi-step attacks against models that use discretized inputs, and present extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN, against standard baselines and, on MNIST and CIFAR-10, against a version of quantization in which the values are represented by a small number of bits.\n\nThe merits of the paper is that the study is rather comprehensive: a large number of datasets were used, two types of discretization were tried, and the authors propose an attack mechanism better that seems reasonable considering the defense they consider. The two main claims of the paper, namely that discretization doesn't hurt performance on natural test examples and that better robustness (in the author's experimental setup) is achieved through the discretized encoding, are properly backed up by the experiments.\n\nYet, the applicability of the method in practice is still to be demonstrated. The threshold effects might imply that small perturbations of the input (in the l_infty sense) will not have a large effect on their discritized version, but it may also go the other way: an opponent might be able to greatly change the discretized input without drastically changing the input. Figure 8 in the appendix is a bit worrysome on that point, as the performance of the discretized version drops rapidly to 0 when the opponents gets a bit stronger. Did the authors observe the same kind of bahavior on other datasets? What would the authors propose to mitigate this issue? To what extend the good results that are exhibited in the paper are valid over the wide range of opponent's strengths?\n\nminor comment:\n- the experiments on CIFAR-100 in Appendix E are carried out by mixing adversarial / clean examples while training, whereas those on SVHN in Appendix F use adversarial examples only.\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Thermometer Encoding: One Hot Way To Resist Adversarial Examples","abstract":"It is well known that it is possible to construct \"adversarial examples\"\nfor neural networks: inputs which are misclassified by the network\nyet indistinguishable from true data.

Using a binary encoding of the input to reduce the attack surface is a brilliant idea. Even though the dimensionality of the input space is increased, the intrinsic dimensionality of the data is drastically reduced. The direct relationship between robustness to adversarial examples and intrinsic dimensionality is well known (paper by Fawzi.). This article exploits this property nicely by designing an encoding that preserves pairwise distances by construction. It is well written overall, and the experiments support the claims of the authors. \n\nThis work has a crucial limitation: scalability.\nThe proposed method scales the input space dimension linearly with the number of discretization steps. Consequently, it has a significant impact on the number of parameters of the model when the dimensionality of the inputs is large. All the experiments in the paper report use relatively small dimensional datasets. For larger input spaces such as Imagenet, the picture could be entirely different:\n\n\t- How would thermometer encoding impact the performance on clean examples for larger dimensionality data (e.g., Imagenet)?\n\t- Would the proposed method be significantly different from bit depth reduction in such setting? \n\t- What would be the impact of the hyper-parameter k in such configuration?\n\t- Would the proposed method still be robust to white box attack?\n\t- The DGA and LS-PGA attacks look at all buckets that are\nwithin Îµ of the actual value, at every step. Would this be feasible in a large dimensional setting? More generally, would the resulting adversarial training technique be practically possible?\n\nWhile positive results on Imagenet would make this work a home run,  negative results would not affect the beauty of the proposal and would shed critical light on the settings in which thermometer encoding is applicable. I lean on the accept side, and I am willing to increase the score greatly if the above questions are answered.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Thermometer Encoding: One Hot Way To Resist Adversarial Examples","abstract":"It is well known that it is possible to construct \"adversarial examples\"\nfor neural networks: inputs which are misclassified by the network\nyet indistinguishable from true data.

This discrepancy is consistent with the commonly-observed \"gradient masking\" problem that can be largely overcome with ensemble adversarial training: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07204.pdf\nIt is possible that combining thermometer encoding and ensemble adversarial training could yield models that retain the white box robustness we have obtained with thermometer encoding but also have increased black box robustness.\nHowever, we have not done enough tests to verify that the issue is gradient masking, so we can't guarantee that ensemble adversarial training would help. This investigation is left to future work.\n\nWe don't understand what you mean by the \"limited gains of PGD-trained themometer target model.\"\nThe thermometer model is trained using LS-PGA adversarial examples, not PGD adversarial examples, but we interpret your comment to mean adversarially-trained thermometer models. We aren't sure whether you mean that adversarial training gives limited improvement to thermometer models or that thermometer models give limited improvement to adversarial training. Neither of these is supported by Table 14. Adversarial training causes thermometer models to become state of the art in all three categories in table 14. Likewise, thermometer coding causes adversarial training to become state of the art in all three categories. If you're concerned that the difference caused by thermometer coding on black box adversarial examples is small enough that it might be statistically insignificant, we can add error bars showing the 95% confidence interval. We can tell you ahead of time that these error bars do not overlap. SVHN has over 26,000 test examples, so the standard error of the test accuracy is smaller than on datasets with smaller test sets like MNIST and CIFAR.\n\nAgain, thank you for your interest."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Thermometer Encoding: One Hot Way To Resist Adversarial Examples","abstract":"It is well known that it is possible to construct \"adversarial examples\"\nfor neural networks: inputs which are misclassified by the network\nyet indistinguishable from true data.
