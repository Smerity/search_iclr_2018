We will definitely release our code as promised.\n\n\n#FID and MS-SSM#\nThanks for pointing us to these interesting works. We have updated our paper and included FID. MS-SSIM does not fit as well into the evaluation framework we are considering as it is an approach that can be combined with the metrics we studied, instead of being a new metric to be compared with. \n\n\n#Approximations to Wasserstein distance#\nThanks for the suggestion. We have indeed considered it, but have found that even the exact Wasserstein distance is not an appealing metric. This makes us believe that it is probably not worth to consider an approximated version. In addition, the approximated Wasserstein distance involves extra hyperparameters, such as network configurations and optimization settings, which further complicates the matter. \n\n\n#Sensitivity to hyperparameters#\nA good evaluation metric should be robust in terms of hyperparameter setting, or ideally, have no hyperparameters. This is indeed satisfied by all the metrics we investigated in this paper, except the MMD. MMD has a single hyperparameter, the Gaussian kernel width, which we empirically set to the averaged pairwise distance of the training data. It appears that MMD is quite insensitive to this hyperparameter.\n\n#Evaluate other generative models and perceptual similarity#\nIn principle it should be possible to use these metrics to evaluate other generative models,  but we have not really investigated that further.

GANs are very popular and widely used, so we hope there is a sufficient amount of interest even if we restrict ourselves to this domain. It should be interesting to extend our research to other generative models in the future.\n\n\n#Visual quality#\nOur paper focuses on evaluating the metrics for GAN, instead of evaluating the generated images of GANs. Indeed, visual quality of GAN generated images are unprecedented, but the ultimate goal of GAN is to learn the hidden generative distribution. From this perspective, GANs can still be improved in various aspects. For example, mode collapse and mode drop cannot be easily discovered by visual inspection only, but can be evaluated using our proposed methods. \n\n\n#Using pretrained model as feature extractor#\nThe pretrained models on ImageNet are very general and robust. They have been widely used for transfer learning (e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation), image style transfer, image super-resolution, etc. The widely used Inception Score also relies on the Inception model pretrained on ImageNet, and it works quite well in practice as an GAN evaluation metric.  In addition, our experiments (Figure 9 in appendix) show that all the observations we have on ResNet also hold on VGG and Inception. \n\n\n#Sole evaluation discriminability#\nIt is important to emphasize that discriminating real and unreal images is not the sole evaluation for “discriminativeness” in our paper. We also considered the prevalent mode dropping and mode collapsing problems. Moreover, even for unreal images, we experimented with three different settings: 1) images generated by a GAN; 2) random noise and 3) images from an entirely different distribution. \n\nDiscriminativeness is not a sufficient condition for a good metric, but seems to be a necessary condition. If a metric does not even pass the discriminativeness test, or other tests in our paper, it might not be a good metric. \n\n#Contradict the argument of Theis et al#\nWe would like to argue that our observations are inline with what have been observed by Theis et al. Specifically, if we directly compute the distances in the pixel space as in Theis et al, most the metrics would fail in terms of discriminability, which is also been observed in their paper. We are able to draw more optimistic observations because of the introduction of a proper feature space.\n\n\n#References#\nThanks for point us to these papers.

The FID is essentially a distance metric for probability distributions, thus it fits into the evaluation framework we investigated. We will include it in our updated version. \n\nFollowing [1], we make the Gaussian distribution assumption on the real/generated data, and test the discriminability of FID. Our preliminary results show that it behaves similarly to the Wasserstein distance under this test. For other properties, we speculate that FID will have a better time/sample complexity than the Wasserstein distance due to the simplified Gaussian distribution assumption. But it might be less sensitive to mode collapse.\n\nOur paper aims to provide a framework to investigate different properties of GAN evaluation metrics. Thus researchers can use it to analyze any sample-based evaluation metric that fits into the framework. As there exist many metrics for probability distributions, we can only focus on several most typical ones (especially those already been used by the GAN community) in our paper.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"An empirical study on evaluation metrics of generative adversarial networks","abstract":"Despite the widespread interest in generative adversarial networks (GANs), few works have studied the metrics that quantitatively evaluate GANs' performance.
