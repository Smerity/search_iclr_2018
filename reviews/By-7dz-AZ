However, the contributed framework did not account for previously proposed metrics (such as equivariance, invariance and equivalence). Within the experimental results, only two methods are considered: although Info-GAN is a reliable competitor, PCA seems a little too basic to compete against. The choice of using noise-free data only is a limiting constraint (in [Chen et al. 2016], Info-GAN is applied to real-world data). \nFinally, in order to corroborate the quantitative results, authors should have reported some visual experiments in order to assess whether a change in c_j really correspond to a change in the corresponding factor of variation z_i according to the learnt monomial matrix.\n\n*Clarity*\nThe explanation of the theoretical framework is not clear. In fact, Figure 1 is straight in identifying disentanglement and completeness as a deviation from an ideal bijective mapping. But, then, the authors missed to clarify how the definitions of D_i and C_j translate this requirement into math. \nAlso, the criterion of informativeness of Section 2 is split into two sub-criteria in Section 3.3, namely test set NRMSE and Zero-Shot NRMSE: such shift needs to be smoothed and better explained, possibly introducing it in Section 2.\n\n*Originality*\nThe paper does not allow to judge whether the three proposed criteria are original or not with respect to the previously proposed ones of [Goodfellow et al. 2009, Lenc & Vedaldi 2015, Cohen & Welling 2014, Jayaraman & Grauman 2015]. \n\n*Significance*\nThe significance of the proposed evaluation framework is not fully clear. The initial assumption of considering factors of variations related to graphics-generated data undermines the relevance of the work. Actually, authors only consider synthetic (noise-free) data belonging to one class only, thus not including the factors of variations related to noise and/or different classes.\n\nPROS: \nThe problem faced by the authors is interesting\n\nCONS:\nThe criteria of disentanglement, informativeness & completeness are not fully clear as they are presented.\nThe proposed criteria are not compared with previously proposed ones - equivariance, invariance and equivalence [Goodfellow et al. 2009, Lenc & Vedaldi 2015, Cohen & Welling 2014, Jayaraman & Grauman 2015]. Thus, it is not possible to elicit from the paper to which extent they are novel or how they are related..\nThe dataset considered is noise-free and considers one class only.

In particular, with respect to the highlighted points 1 and 2, point 1 has been thoroughly answered and the novelty with respect previous work is now clearly stated in the paper. Despite the same level of clarification has not been reached for what concerns point 2, the proposed framework (although still limited in relevance due to the lack of more realistic settings) can be useful for the community as a benchmark to verify the level of disentanglement than newly proposed deep architectures can achieve.

How do the authors propose to deal with multimodal true latent factors? What if multiple sets of z can generate the same observations and how does the evaluation of disentanglement fairly work if the underlying model cannot be uniquely recovered from the data?\n2. Scoring disentanglement against known sources of variation is sensible and studied well here, but how would the authors evaluate or propose to evaluate in datasets with unknown sources of variation?\n3. the actual sources of variation are interpretable and explicit measurable quantities here. However, oftentimes a source of variation can be a variable that is hard or impossible to express in a simple vector z (for instance the sentiment of a scene) even when these factors are known. How do the authors propose to move past narrow definitions of factors of variation and handle more complex variables? Arguably, disentangling is a step towards concept learning and concepts might be harder to formalize than the approach taken here where in the experiment the variables are well-behaved and relatively easy to quantify since they relate to image formation physics.\n4. For a paper introducing a formal experimental framework and metrics or evaluation I find that the paper is light on experiments and evaluation.

Furthermore the authors could consider applying their framework to other datasets and offering a benchmark experiment and code for the community to establish this as a means of evaluation to maximize the impact of a paper aimed at reproducibility and good science.\n\nNovelty:\nPrevious papers like \"beta-VAE\" (Higgins et al. 2017) and \"Bayesian Representation Learning With Oracle Constraints\" by Karaletsos et al (ICLR 16) have followed similar experimental protocols inspired by the same underlying idea of recovering known latent factors, but have fallen short of proposing a formal framework like this paper does. It would be good to add a section gathering such attempts at evaluation previously made and trying to unify them under the proposed framework.\n","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"A framework for the quantitative evaluation of disentangled representations","abstract":"Recent AI research has emphasized the importance of learning  disentangled representations of the explanatory factors behind data.
