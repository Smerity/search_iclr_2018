The introduced stochasticity is the result of the stochastic functions as the adversary’s strategies. The introduced approach, however, can be perceived as a mechanism for smoothing the gradients. This is to mitigate the model collapse issue. In order to see how DS-AAE can address the mode collapse issue, please consider a case when there is a \"hole\" in the learned coding space (which would be expected in the course of training - The learned coding space is also visualized in Fig.2a and Fig. 2c after training).  In such cases, the adversary cannot discriminate against the boundaries around the \"hole\" properly.  This is because of the bumpy gradients terms. This leads to mode collapse issue, discussed at the introduction and is indeed the main motivation for proposing DS-AAE. The bumpy gradient terms can be avoided using DS-AAE architecture.
