They further suggest two hash functions and study the role of different properties of these hash functions in the performance.\n\nThe paper is well-written and clear. It is a follow-up on Chen et al. (2015) which introduced HashedNets. Therefore, the idea of using hash functions is not novel. This paper suggests a framework to study different hash functions. However, the experimental results do not seem adequate to validate this framework. One issue here is lack of a baseline for performance comparison. Otherwise, the significance of the results is not clear.\n\n\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Balanced and Deterministic Weight-sharing Helps Network Performance","abstract":"Weight-sharing plays a significant role in the success of many deep neural networks, by increasing memory efficiency and incorporating useful inductive priors about the problem into the network.

In this framework, any existing neural network architectures, including CNN and RNN, could be incorporated into ArbNets.\n\nThe manuscript is not well written. There are multiple grammar errors and typos. Content-wise, it is already well known that CNN and RNN can be expressed as general MLP with weight sharing. The introduction of ArbNets does not bring much value or insight to this area. So it seems that most content before experimental section is common sense.\n\nIn the experimental section, it is interesting to see how different hash function with different level of entropy can affect the performance of neural nets. However, this single observation cannot enrich the whole manuscript. Two questions:\n(1) What is the definition of sparsity here, and how is it controlled?\n(2) There seems to be a step change in Figure 3. All the results are either between 10 to 20, or near 50. And the blue line goes up and down. Is this expected?","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Balanced and Deterministic Weight-sharing Helps Network Performance","abstract":"Weight-sharing plays a significant role in the success of many deep neural networks, by increasing memory efficiency and incorporating useful inductive priors about the problem into the network.
