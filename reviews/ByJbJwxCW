Please find our response below:\n\nOriginality - I find the paper to be very incremental in terms of originality of the method. \n>> We agree that the ideas presented here are simple. However, we want to point out that the simple way of looking at RNNs in MIL settings has not been presented before to the best of our knowledge.

Also, we show that such a frustratingly simple RNN model can achieve excellent performance compared to the other existing MIL approaches.\n\nQuality and Significance - Due to small size of the cohort and lack of additional dataset, it is difficult to reliably access quality of experiments.

The revision didn't address my concerns, and I've lowered my rating.\n\n==== Original Review ====\nThis paper proposed a novel Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) formulation called Relation MIL (RMIL), and discussed a number of its variants with LSTM, Bi-LSTM, S2S, etc. The paper also explored integrating RMIL with various attention mechanisms, and demonstrated its usage on medical concept prediction from time series data.\n\nThe biggest technical innovation in this paper is it combines recurrent networks like Bi-LSTM with MIL to model the relations among instances. Other than that, the paper has limited technical innovations: the pooling functions were proposed earlier and their integration with MIL was widely studied before (as cited by the authors); the attention mechanisms are also proposed by others.\n\nHowever, I am doubtful whether itâ€™s appropriate to use LSTM to model the relations among instances. In general MIL, there exists no temporal order among instances, so modeling them with a LSTM is unjustified. It might be acceptable is the authors are focusing on time-series data; but in this case, itâ€™s unclear why the authors are applying MIL on it. It seems other learning paradigm could be more appropriate.\n\nThe biggest concern I have with this paper is the unconvincing experiments. First, the baselines are very weak.

The main difference from the typical MIL setup is that there is a temporal relationship between the instances in each bag.  The authors propose to model this using a recurrent neural network architecture.  The aggregation function which maps instance-level labels to bag-level labels is modeled using a pooling layer (this is actually a nice way to describe multi-instance classification assumptions using neural network terminology).  An attention mechanism is also used.\n\nThe proposed time-series MIL problem formulation makes sense.  The RNN approach is novel to this setting, if somewhat incremental.  One very positive aspect is that results are reported exploring the impact of the choice of recurrent neural network architecture, pooling function, and attention mechanism.  Results on a second dataset are reported in the appendix, which greatly increases confidence in the generalizability of the experiments.  One or more additional datasets would have helped further solidify the results, although I appreciate that medical datasets are not always easy to obtain.  Overall, this is a reasonable paper with no obvious major flaws.  The novelty and impact may be greater on the application side than on the methodology side.\n\nMinor suggestions:\n\n-The term \"relational multi-instance learning\" seems to suggest a greater level of generality than the work actually accomplishes.  The proposed methods can only handle time-series / longitudinal dependencies, not arbitrary relational structure.  Moreover, multi-instance learning is typically viewed as an intermediary level of structure \"in between\" propositional learning (i.e. the standard supervised learning setting) and fully relational learning, so the \"relational multi-instance learning\" terminology sounds a little strange.
