Our results show that both AC-GAN and GMM achieve much worse results. To further evaluate the generative model, we experimented with using only generated data to train the classifiers (Fig.8). Our results in the revised manuscript suggest that using several hundred fake images per class is comparable to using real images.\n\n- w.r.t. improvements to classification performance: We point the reviewer to Tab. 4 for a comparison of different GAN architectures. Also, we mention that for the results reported in Tab. 1-3, both SVM and deep net classifiers are compared with and without artificially generated data. We think this clearly demonstrates the benefits of adding data obtained from GANs. The high performance of the baselines, resulting from careful tuning, are easily on par with typically reported numbers in the literature. Moreover, we point out that the reported improvements are consistent across a variety of metrics. This experimental evaluation suggests that the reported improvements aren’t small and are hard to achieve. In Tab. 5 of the revised manuscript, we provide the variance of the cross-validated performance. The small variances suggest the significance of the performance differences. \n\n- w.r.t. illustrated brain maps and brain decoding: We refer the reviewer to Fig. 5 in the manuscript and Fig. 11-13 in the supplementary material for additional results. We have clarified details as requested, for instance, Fig. 5 and Fig. 13 show the synthetic images with label ‘7’ in collection 503 by the ACD-GAN and ICW-GAN respectively.\n\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Hallucinating brains with artificial brains","abstract":"Human brain function as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging\n(fMRI), exhibits a rich diversity.

The improvement is really tiny and a statistical test (not included in the analysis) probably wouldn't pass a significant threshold.  This analysis is missing a straw man. It is not clear whether the difference in the evaluation measures is related to the greater number of examples or by the specific generative model.\nConcerning the contribution of the model, one novelty is the conditional formulation of the discriminator. The design of the empirical evaluation doesn't address the analysis of the impact of this new formulation. It is not clear whether the supposed improvement is related to the conditional formulation. \nFigure 3 and Figure 5 illustrate the brain maps generated for Collection 1952 with ICW-GAN and for collection 503 with ACD-GAN. It is not clear how the authors operated the choices of these figures. From the perspective of neuroscience a reader,  would expect to look at the brain maps for the same collection with different methods. The pairwise brain maps would support the interpretation of the generated data. It is worthwhile to remember that the location of brain activations is crucial to detect whether the brain decoding (classification) relies on artifacts or confounds.\n\nMinor comments\n- typos: \"a first application or this\" => \"a first application of this\" (p.2)\n- \"qualitative quality\" (p.2)","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Hallucinating brains with artificial brains","abstract":"Human brain function as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging\n(fMRI), exhibits a rich diversity.
