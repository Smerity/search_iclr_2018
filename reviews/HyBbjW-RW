DPPs are probability distributions over subsets of a ground set with the property that subsets with more \"diverse\" elements have higher probability. Diverse here is defined using some similarity metric, often a kernel. Under the RBF kernel, the more diverse a set of vectors is, the closer the kernel matrix becomes to the identity matrix, and thus the larger the determinant (and therefore probability under the DPP) grows. The authors propose to do hyperparameter tuning by sampling a set of hyperparameter evaluations from a DPP with the RBF kernel.\n\nOverall, I have a couple of concerns about novelty as well as the experimental evaluation for the authors to address. As the authors rightly point out, sampling hyperparameter values from a DPP is equivalent to sampling proportional to the posterior uncertainy of a Gaussian process, effectively leading to a pure exploration algorithm. As the authors additionally point out, such methods have been considered before, including methods that directly propose to batch Bayesian optimization by choosing a single exploitative point and sampling the remainder of the batch from a DPP (e.g., [Kathuria et al., 2016]). The default procedure for parallel BayesOpt used by SMAC [R2] is (I believe) also to choose a purely explorative batch. I am unconvinced by the argument that \"while this can lead to easy parallelization within one iteration of Bayesian optimization, the overall algorithms are still sequential.\" These methods can typically be expanded to arbitrarily large batches and fully utilize all parallel hardware. Most implementations of batch Bayesian optimization in practice (SMAC and Spearmint as examples) will even start new jobs immediately as jobs finish -- these implementations do not wait for the entire batch to finish typically.\n\nAdditionally, while there has been some work extending GP-based BayesOpt to tree-based parameters [R3], at a minimum SMAC in particular is known well suited to the tree-based parameter search considered by the authors. I am not sure that I agree that TPE is state-of-the-art on these problems: SMAC typically does much better in my experience. \n\nUltimately, my concern is that--considering these tools are open source and relatively stable software at this point--if DPP-only based hyperparameter optimization is truly better than the parallelization approach of SMAC, it should be straightforward enough to download SMAC and demonstrate this. If the argument that BayesOpt is somehow \"still sequential\" is true, then k-DPP-RBF should outperform these tools in terms of wall clock time to perform optimization, correct?\n\n[R1] Kathuria, Tarun and Deshpande, Amit and Kohli, Pushmeet.

(2011). The k-DPP sampling algorithm and the concept of k-DPP-RBF over hyperparameters are not new, so the main contribution here is the empirical study. \n\nThe first experiment by the authors shows that k-DPP-RBF gives better star discrepancy than uniform random search while being comparable to low-discrepancy Sobol sequences in other metrics such as distance from the center or an arbitrary corner (Fig. 1).\n\nThe second experiment shows surprisingly that for the hard learning rate range, k-DPP-RBF performs better than uniform random search, and moreover, both of these outperform BO-TPE (Fig. 2, column 1).\n\nThe third experiment shows that on good or stable ranges, k-DPP-RBF and its discrete analog slightly outperform uniform random search and its discrete analog, respectively.\n\nI have a few reservations. First, I do not find these outcomes very surprising or informative, except for the second experiment (Fig. 2, column 1). Second, their study only applies to a small number like 3-6 hyperparameters with a small k=20. The real challenge lies in scaling up to many hyperparameters or even k-DPP sampling for larger k. Third, the authors do not compare against some relevant, recent work, e.g., Springenberg et al. (http://aad.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/papers/16-NIPS-BOHamiANN.pdf) and Snoek et al. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.05700.pdf) that is essential for this kind of empirical study. \n\n  ","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Open Loop Hyperparameter Optimization and Determinantal Point Processes","abstract":"Driven by the need for parallelizable hyperparameter optimization methods, this paper studies \\emph{open loop} search methods: sequences that are predetermined and can be generated before a single configuration is evaluated.

The most common approaches\nare uniform random search and grid search, but more recently\nlow-discrepancy sequences have sometimes been used to try to achieve\nbetter coverage of the space.  This paper proposes using a variant of\nthe determinantal point process, the k-DPP to select these points.\nThe idea is that the DPP provides an alternative form of diversity to\nlow-discrepancy sequences.\n\nSome issues I have with this paper:\n\n1. Why a DPP? It's pretty heavyweight. Why not use any of the other\n(potentially cheaper) repulsive point processes that also achieve\ndiversity?  Is there anything special about it that justifies this\nwork?\n\n2. What about all of the literature on space-filling designs, e.g.,\nlatin hypercube designs?  Statisticians have thought about this for a\nlong time.\n\n3. The motivation for not using low-discrepancy sequences was discrete\nhyperparameters.  In practice, people just chop up the space or round.\nIs a simple kernel with one length scale on a one-hot coding adding\nvalue? In this setup, each parameter can only contribute \"same or\ndifferent\" to the diversity assessment.  In any case, the evaluations\ndidn't have any discrete parameters.  Given that the discrete setting\nwas the motivation for the DPP over LDS, it seems strange not to even\nlook at that case.\n\n4. How do you propose handling ordinal variables? They're a common\ncase of discrete variables but it wouldn't be sensible to use a\none-hot coding.\n\n5. Why no low discrepancy sequence in the experimental evaluation of\nsection 5?  Since there's no discrete parameters, I don't see what the\nlimitation is.\n\n6. Why not evaluate any other low discrepancy sequences than Sobol?\n\n7. I didn't understand the novelty of the MCMC method relative to\nvanilla M-H updates.  It seems out of place.\n\n8. The figures really need error bars --- Figure 3 in particular.  Are\nthese differences statistically significant?\n","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Open Loop Hyperparameter Optimization and Determinantal Point Processes","abstract":"Driven by the need for parallelizable hyperparameter optimization methods, this paper studies \\emph{open loop} search methods: sequences that are predetermined and can be generated before a single configuration is evaluated.
