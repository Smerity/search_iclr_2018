First, as described in our previous comment, we ran an extensive evaluation in five more mazes and with variable hyperparameters, clearly demonstrating the advantage of our method over baselines. We also introduced an improved localization method which can better deal with perceptual aliasing. All these results are already shown and discussed in the revised paper.\n\nMore recently, we performed two more series of experiments requested by the reviewers: on navigation in DMLab-like environments with ambiguous textures, and on non-human exploration. These experiments show that our method can work even with sparse landmarks and non-human exploration. These results are not yet discussed in the paper, but we will add them to the final version. Note that operation in the ambiguous textures scenario is made possible by the simple improvement to agent’s localization: instead of localizing independently per frame, we smooth the self-localization of the agent by biasing it towards localization from the previous step (see Sec. 3.1, “Finding the waypoint”, for a description). We now describe these experiments in more detail.\n\nIn the first series of experiments, we re-created in Vizdoom the environments from DMLab used by Mirowski et al. with exactly the same layout and similar sparsity of landmarks. We additionally used 2 mazes from our own set with DMLab-like texture distribution, bringing the number of mazes to a total of 4. The walkthroughs for those environments are shown in the following videos: https://youtu.be/MS8ReBruns4 , https://youtu.be/Jlhkc-9hZdo , https://youtu.be/Ko5-SB6CpyQ , https://youtu.be/Rlgl01S7PQQ . Those environments are highly ambiguous: walls are mostly covered with a single texture, with occasional distinct textures.\nResults: we report success rate @5000 steps, higher is better. In the mazes DMLab small (Test-1 in our notation), DMLab large (Val-3 in our notation), Test-5, Test-4 the method achieves the following results (respectively):\n89%, 44%, 68%, 48%.\nThis can be compared to the results of our method in the corresponding visually rich environments, as reported in the paper:\n100%, 97%, 76%, 89%.\nThe results of best RL-based baselines are (respectively):\n53%, 21%, 32%, 25%.\nClearly, in ambiguous environments the performance of the proposed method drops, but the method does not break down completely and still outperforms the baselines by a large margin. Videos of navigating agent are available at https://youtu.be/NpfAF6LILXc , https://youtu.be/cZ5RMGs4LE8 , https://youtu.be/8ehxeeHiK-E . We point out that it is incorrect to assume that ambiguous environments are more realistic than visually rich environments from our previous experiments: both types of environments exist in real world. Yet, we admit that these visually ambiguous environments remain challenging for our method, and in future work we plan to further improve the model so as to better deal with these.\n\nIn the second experiment, we aimed to verify that our method still works even when given inefficient non-human exploration. For that purpose, we used traversals from the RL-based baseline with LSTM memory (see the paper). Of course, this only works for simple environments. Even for these, most traversals don't go through all the goals. To avoid this problem, we sampled the traversals until they covered all the goals. It took roughly 20 attempts for the mazes we tried. Here we report the results on 2 mazes: Test-1, Test-4. Those were chosen as the simplest so that the exploration heuristic works. The results are:\n63%, 52%\nFor human traversal before:\n100%, 89%\nThe best baselines were:\n53%, 25%\nAs can be seen, our method does not break here either, still beats the baselines, although by a smaller margin. Obviously, the agent's tracks get longer as the inefficient exploration wastes time instead of moving between different locations quickly (for example, see exploration tracks here: https://youtu.be/NHjqQS-d_ko , https://youtu.be/cEaaPVUu17I ).\n\nWe hope these results persuade the reviewers that the proposed method is generally applicable and promising. We will continue working on the remaining experiments proposed by the reviewers.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Semi-parametric topological memory for navigation","abstract":"We introduce a new memory architecture for navigation in previously unseen environments, inspired by landmark-based navigation in animals.

In fact, exploration of a previously unseen environment is a very difficult problem of its own, which itself needs memory: in order to know which parts of the environment to explore, the agent needs to know where it is currently located and which parts had already been explored. In this work, we make a useful contribution by designing the memory module. Using it for exploration (potentially in combination with RL) is a very exciting avenue for future work.\n\nThe proposed method can be seen as an advanced version of visual imitation learning (the agent does not have access to the expert’s actions!) combined with mapping. Interestingly, a concurrent submission to ICLR proposes to use a method very similar to our locomotion network for visual imitation learning: https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkisuzWRW .\n\n> A human operator labels 10k frames by playing the game and controlling the agent, to show it how the maze looks like and what are the paths to be taken. As a consequence, comparison to end-to-end RL navigation methods is unclear, and should be stressed upon in the manuscript. \n\nThere seems to be some misunderstanding here. The operator does not “label” the images: the actions taken by the human are not available to the agent, only the observed image sequence. This image sequence is provided both to our agent and the baseline agents at test time. At training time, none of the agents have access to human demonstrations. Therefore, the comparison is fair.  \n\n> a fully Dijkstra-based baseline where the direction of motion of the agent along the edge is retrieved and used to guide the agent\n\nIf we understand the suggestion correctly, it requires recording the expert’s actions during the walkthrough and then repeating them at test time. As noted above, in our setup the actions from the walkthrough sequence *are not available* to the agents. Therefore this baseline has access to more information than the methods evaluated in the paper. Nevertheless, we will work on evaluating this baseline and including it in the paper. \n\n> the localization network replaced by image similarities in pixel space or some image descriptor space (e.g., SURF, ORB, etc…). \n\nThanks for this suggestion!

We will add a discussion to the paper. However, note that experiments by Oh et al. are performed in gridworld-like environments, in contrast with large mazes with continuous state space in our work. We expect that scaling the method of Oh et al. to these environments will be challenging. We will compare to the work of Oh et al. and will include the results in the paper.\n\n> Unfortunately, that episodic memory is not learned (e.g., Neural Turing Machines or Memory Networks).\n\nIndeed the memory is not learned end-to-end via RL, but both the embedding and the locomotion network are learned in self-supervised fashion.

The basic version of our approach, presented in the paper, is indeed unable to disambiguate two identical observations. We implemented a simple modification of the approach: when localizing itself in the graph, the agent first searches in a neighborhood of the previous location, and only resorts for localizing itself in the whole graph if no confident match is found in this first step. This introduces temporal smoothness to localization of the agent, partially addresses the  perceptual aliasing problem, and improves the performance of the method, especially in complex mazes. We will add a comparison of the naive and the advanced versions of the method to the paper. More principled treatment of perceptual aliasing is an important direction of future work.\n\n> The problem is mitigated by the fact that a human operator controls the agent, making sure that the agent's viewpoint is clear, but the method will probably fail if the agent is learning to explore the maze autonomously, bumping into walls and facing walls\n\nIt is true that the method can be sensitive to the exploration sequence, and there is room for improvement. However, we would like to point out that 1) in this paper we focus on the memory architecture, 2) any mapping method would be sensitive to the properties of the walkthrough sequence, 3) availability of a short human exploration sequence is a reasonable assumption in many practical settings, for instance for a household robot, and 4) the baselines get access to exactly the same walkthrough sequence.\n\nTo analyze the robustness of the method to the properties of the walkthrough sequence, we will perform experiments with non-human exploration and include the results in the paper.\n\n> The screenshots on Figure 3 suggest that the walls have a large variety of textures and decorations, making each viewpoint potentially unique, unlike the environments in (Mirowski et al, 2017), (Jaderberg et al, 2017) and (Mnih et al, 2016).\n\nIt is true that our environments are different from the aforementioned DM Lab ones in terms of the texture distribution. This video https://youtu.be/4QxO8mdOf3M shows a walkthrough sequence of the Test-Difficult maze (other mazes are similar in texture distribution). Indeed the textures are diverse, but they are also repetitive, so the same seemingly discriminative texture appears in multiple locations in the maze. Moreover, the floor and the ceiling textures are uniform. This makes localization challenging. In the DM Lab environments, on the other hand, the floor textures vary, and walls are populated with unique “markers”. \n\nThe textures we used were procedurally and randomly placed on the walls. We agree that additional evaluation on DM Lab environments or qualitatively similar ones in ViZDoom would be interesting and will work on adding these results to the paper.\n\n\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Semi-parametric topological memory for navigation","abstract":"We introduce a new memory architecture for navigation in previously unseen environments, inspired by landmark-based navigation in animals.

The method combines an algorithmic approach to generate topological graphs, which is indexed by observations with Dijkstra's algorithm to determine a global path from which a waypoint observation is selected. The waypoint along with the current observation is fed to a learned local planner that transitions the agent to the target waypoint. A learned observation similarity mapping localizes the agent and indexes targets in the graph.\n\nThe novelty of the approach in context of prior visual navigation and landmark-based robotics research is the hybrid algorithmic and learned approach that builds a graph purely from observations without ego motion or direct state estimation. Most of the individual components have previously appeared in the literature including graph search (also roadmap methods), learned similarity metrics, and learned observation-based local planners. However, the combination of these approaches along with some of the presented nuanced enhancements including the connectivity shortcuts (a simple form of loop closure) to visual topological navigation and are compelling contributions. The results while not thorough do support the ability of the method effectively plan on novel and unseen environments.\n\nThe approach has potential limitations including the linear growth in the size of the memory, and it is unclear how the method handles degenerate observations (e.g., similar looking hallways on opposite sides of the environment).

The path planning in unseen environments is done in the following way: first a human operator traverses the entire environment by controlling the agent and collecting a long episode of 10k frames that are put into a chain graph. Then loop closures are automatically detected using image similarity in feature space, using a localization feed-forward ResNet (trained using a DrLIM-like triplet loss on time-similar images), resulting in a topological graph where edges correspond to similar viewpoints or similar time points. For a given target position image and agent start position image, a nearest neighbor search-powered Dijkstra path planning is done on the graph to create a list of waypoint images. The pairs of (current image, next waypoint) images are then fed to a feed-forward locomotion (policy) network, trained in a supervised manner.\n\nThe paper does not discuss at all the problems arising when the images are ambiguous: since the localisation network is feed-forward, surely there must be images that are ambiguously mapped to different graph areas and are closing loops erroneously? The problem is mitigated by the fact that a human operator controls the agent, making sure that the agent's viewpoint is clear, but the method will probably fail if the agent is learning to explore the maze autonomously, bumping into walls and facing walls. The screenshots on Figure 3 suggest that the walls have a large variety of textures and decorations, making each viewpoint potentially unique, unlike the environments in (Mirowski et al, 2017), (Jaderberg et al, 2017) and (Mnih et al, 2016).\n\nMost importantly, the navigation is not based on RL at all, and ignores the problem of exploration altogether. A human operator labels 10k frames by playing the game and controlling the agent, to show it how the maze looks like and what are the paths to be taken. As a consequence, comparison to end-to-end RL navigation methods is unclear, and should be stressed upon in the manuscript. This is NOT a proper navigation agent.\n\nAdditional baselines should be evaluated: 1) a fully Dijkstra-based baseline where the direction of motion of the agent along the edge is retrieved and used to guide the agent (i.e., the policy becomes a lookup table on image pairs) and 2) the same but the localization network replaced by image similarities in pixel space or some image descriptor space (e.g., SURF, ORB, etc…). It seems to me that those baselines would be very strong.\n\nAnother baseline is missing: (Oh et al, 2016, “Control of Memory, Active Perception, and Action in Minecraft”).\n\nThe paper is not without merit: the idea of storing experiences in a graph and in using landmark similarity rather than metric embeddings is interesting. Unfortunately, that episodic memory is not learned (e.g., Neural Turing Machines or Memory Networks).\n\nIn summary, just like the early paper released in 2010 about Kinect-based RGBD SLAM: lots of excitement but potential disappointment when the method is applied on an actual mobile robot, navigating in normal environments with visual ambiguity and white walls. The paper should ultimately be accepted to this conference to provide a baseline for the community  (once the claims are revised), but I street that the claims of learning to navigate in unseen environments are unsubstantiated, as the method is neither end-to-end learned (as it relies on human input and heuristic path planning) nor capable of exploring unseen environments with visual ambiguity.","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":2,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Semi-parametric topological memory for navigation","abstract":"We introduce a new memory architecture for navigation in previously unseen environments, inspired by landmark-based navigation in animals.
