As one of the listed contributions, the authors propose using policy gradient. However, in this setting, the reward is a known differentiable function, and the action is continuous, and thus one could simply backpropagate through to get the gradients on the encoder. Also, it seems the reward is not a function of the future actions, which further questions the need for a reinforcement learning formulation.\n\nThe paper is written poorly. For instance, I don't understand what this sentence means: \"We condition the latent variables to come from rich distributions\". Observed accent labels are referred to as latent (hidden) variables.\n\nWhile the independent Wasserstein critic is useful to study whether models are overfitting (by comparing train/heldout numbers), their use for comparing across different model types is not justified. Moreover, since GAN-based methods optimize the Wasserstein distance directly, it cannot serve as a metric to compare GAN-based models with other models.\n\nAll of the models compared against do not use accent information during training (table 2), so this is not a fair comparison.\n\nOverall, the paper lacks any novel technical insight, contributions are not explained well, exposition is poor, and the evaluations are invalid.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"POLICY DRIVEN GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS FOR ACCENTED SPEECH GENERATION","abstract":"In this paper, we propose the generation of accented speech using generative adversarial\nnetworks.

The proposed approach relies on a generative adversarial network (GAN), combined with a policy approach for joining together generated speech segments. The latter is used to deal with the problem of generating very long sequences (which is generally difficult with GANs).\n\nThe problem of generating accented speech is very relevant since accent plays a large role in human communication and speech technology. Unfortunately, this paper is hard to follow. Some of the approach details are unclear and the research is not motivated well. The evaluation does not completely support the claims of the paper, e.g., there is no human judgment of whether the generated audio actually matches the desired accent.\n\nDetailed comments, suggestions, and questions:\n- It would be very useful to situate the research within work from the speech community. Why is accented modelling important? How is this done at the moment in speech synthesis systems? The paper gives some references, but without context. The paper from Ikeno and Hansen below might be useful.\n- Accents are also a big problem in speech recognition (references below). Could your approach give accent-invariant representations for recognition?\n- Figure 1: Add $x$, $y$, and the other variables you mention in Section 3 to the figure.\n- What is $o$ in eq. (1)?\n- Could you add a citation for eq. (2)? This would also help justifying that \"it has a smoother curve and hence allows for more meaningful gradients\".\n- With respect to the critic $C_\\nu$, I can see that it might be helpful to add structure to the hidden representation. In the evaluation, could you show the effect of having/not having this critic (sorry if I missed it)? The statement about \"more efficient layers\" is not clear.\n- Section 3.4: If I understand correctly, this is a nice idea for ensuring that generated segments are combined sensibly. It would be helpful defining with \"segments\" refer to, and stepping through the audio generation process.\n- Section 4.1: \"using which we can\" - typo.\n- Section 5.1: \"Figure 1 shows how the Wasserstein distance ...\" I think you refer to the figure with Table 1?\n- Figure 4: Add (a), (b) and (c) to the relevant parts in the figure.\n\nReferences that might be useful:\n- Ikeno, Ayako, and John HL Hansen. \"The effect of listener accent background on accent perception and comprehension.\" EURASIP Journal on Audio, Speech, and Music Processing 2007, no. 3 (2007): 4.\n- Van Compernolle, Dirk. \"Recognizing speech of goats, wolves, sheep and… non-natives.\" Speech Communication 35, no. 1 (2001): 71-79.\n- Benzeghiba, Mohamed, Renato De Mori, Olivier Deroo, Stephane Dupont, Teodora Erbes, Denis Jouvet, Luciano Fissore et al. \"Automatic speech recognition and speech variability: A review.\" Speech communication 49, no. 10 (2007): 763-786.\n- Wester, Mirjam, Cassia Valentini-Botinhao, and Gustav Eje Henter. \"Are We Using Enough Listeners?

Unfortunately, the work is not presented or evaluated well, and I therefore give a week reject.\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"POLICY DRIVEN GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS FOR ACCENTED SPEECH GENERATION","abstract":"In this paper, we propose the generation of accented speech using generative adversarial\nnetworks.
