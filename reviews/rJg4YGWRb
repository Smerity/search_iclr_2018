Taking the reviews and comments to heart we have made several changes which, we believe, greatly improve our paper. We added comparison of performance of AGNN with different number of propagation layers in Appendix C. In the Appendix D, we added experimental results of GCN on both random splits and cross-validation settings. Further, we have expanded the bibliography in the Sections 2 and 4.1. As per the reviews we have also made changes to notations and presentation style in Sections 3 and 4. In Section 5.2 and Appendix A, we corrected the order of class names. We improved the caption and marked training set nodes in Figures 2, 4, 5 and 6.

Confusing notation is corrected: In the revised version $c$ indexes a label.\n\n2. Why GLN works:  For semi-supervised learning, we believe that the primary gain of using graph neural network comes from the “Averaging” effect. Similar to denoising pixels in images, by averaging neighbors features, we get a denoised version of current nodes’ features. This gives significant gain over those estimations without denoising (such as Mulit-Layer Perceptron in Table 2). This, we believe, is why GLN is already achieving the state-of-the-art performance. The focus of this paper is how to get the next remaining gain, which we achieve by proposing asymmetric averaging using “attention”. So far, we did not see any noticeable gain in non-linear activation for semi-supervised learning. However, we believe such non-linearity can be important for other applications, such as graph classification tasks on molecular networks. \n\n3. Attention in GCN: GCN with attention did not give gain over our AGNN architecture, which is somewhat expected as GCN and GLN have comparable performances, within the error margin of each other. Note that from the architecture complexity perspective AGNN is simpler than GCN with attention, meaning that AGNN might have a better chance explaining the data.\n\n4. Symmetric attention: Even though the scaled cosine similarity would be symmetric between two connected nodes $i$ and $j$, the attention value itself can be different due to the fact that softmax computations are calculated on different neighborhoods: $N(i)$ and $N(j)$ respectively.\nBut we agree that attention mechanism has an element of symmetry and this might be alleviated by using more complex attention mechanism. As the reviewer pointed out, we chose the simple attention mechanism here; we tried various attention mechanisms with varying degrees of complexity, and found the simple attention mechanism to give the best performance. Training complex attention is challenging, and we would like to explore more complex ones in our future work.\n\nResponse to detailed comments:\n\n1. Details on Graph Laplacian Regularization: We added details about Laplacian regularization for completeness of discussion of previous work and because Laplacian regularizations closely related to the propagations layers used in almost all Graph Neural Network papers.\n2. ‘Skip-grams’: We added some clarification on the use of ‘skip-grams’ in the revised version.\n3. ‘Natural random walk’ on a graph is random walk where one move from a node to one of its neighbors selected with uniform probability. We have clarified this in the revised version.\n4. Presentation of the Attention-based Graph Neural Network: Thanks for pointing this out.

Attention mechanism:  It is true as the reviewer pointed out that our attention mechanism is very simple. We settled on this choice after training/testing several attention mechanisms, most of which are more complex than the one we propose. The proposed simple attention mechanism gave the best performance, among those we tried. We believe this is due to the fact that complex attention mechanisms are harder to train as there are more parameters to learn.\n\n2. GCN on other training sets: The reason we do not report GCN performance in tables 2 and 3 is that we made it our rule not to run other researcher’s algorithms ourselves, at the fear of not doing justice in the hyperparameters we need to choose.   However, given the interest in the numerical comparisons, as the reviewer pointed out, in the revised version, we run these experiments  and reported the performance of GCN in the appendix D (as it might give the wrong impression that those results are performed by the authors of GCN, if we put it in the table in the main text).\n\n3.

Regarding the similar variance of results of AGNN and GLN: In Table 2 of the original version we don’t report the variance or standard-deviation of accuracies of the trials, but we report (as mentioned in paragraph 1 on page 3 of original version) standard-error which defined as standard-deviation/square-root(number of trials) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error).  That being said, when the training data is fixed (as is the case for Table 2), the variance of GLN is smaller than that of AGNN as predicted by the reviewer, as the only source of randomness is the initialization of the neural network weights. On the other hand, when the training data is chosen randomly (As is the case for Tables 3 and 4), there are two sources of randomness and the variance of GLN and AGNN are harder to predict and compare. We could not predict how different choices of the training data affects the accuracy, and it can happen that GLN has larger variance than AGNN.\n\n2. Regarding Figure 2.: We apologize for the lack of clarity in its caption. The thick nodes are from the test set whose labels are not known to the model at training time. For clarification, we have now added `*’ (asterisk) to mark nodes from the training set whose labels were revealed to the model during training (e.g. Figure 4). Coincidentally none of the neighborhood in Figure 2 have any nodes from the training set.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Attention-based Graph Neural Network for Semi-supervised Learning","abstract":"Recently popularized graph neural networks achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy on a number of standard benchmark datasets for graph-based semi-supervised learning, improving significantly over existing approaches.

The Algorithm is inspired from Graph Neural Networks and more precisely graph convolutional NNs recently proposed by ref (Kipf et al  2016)) in the paper.  These NNs alternate 2 types of layers:  non linear projection and diffusion, the latter incorporates the graph relational information by constraining neighbor nodes to have close representations according to some “graph metrics”. The authors propose a model with simplified projection layers and more sophisticated diffusion ones, incorporating a simple attention mechanism. Experiments are performed on citation textual datasets. Comparisons with published results on the same datasets are presented.\n\nThe paper is clear and develops interesting ideas relevant to semi-supervised graph node classification. One finding is that simple models perform as well as more complex ones in this setting where labeled data is scarce. Another one is the importance of integrating relational information for classifying nodes when it is available. The attention mechanism itself is extremely simple, and learns one parameter per diffusion layers. One parameter weights correlations between node embeddings in a diffusion layer. I understand that you tried more complex attention mechanisms, but the one finally selected is barely an attention mechanism and rather a simple “importance” weight. This is not a criticism, but this makes the title somewhat misleading. The experiments show that the proposed model is state of the art for graph node classification. The performance is on par with some other recent models according to table 2. The other tests are also interesting, but the comparison could have been extended to other models e.g. GCN.\nYou advocate the role of the diffusion layers, and in the experiments you stack 3 to 4 such layers. It would be interesting to have indications on the compromise performance/ number of diffusion layers and on the evolution of these performances when adding such layers.\nThe bibliography on semi-supervised learning in graphs for classification is light and should be enhanced.\nOverall this is an interesting paper with nice findings.

Overall, there was no hyperparameter tuning for the linear model, and all the numbers should provide fair comparisons.\n\nThank you for the references, we will surely include and discuss all the great prior work you pointed out. \n\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Attention-based Graph Neural Network for Semi-supervised Learning","abstract":"Recently popularized graph neural networks achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy on a number of standard benchmark datasets for graph-based semi-supervised learning, improving significantly over existing approaches.

We were not aware of this line of literature when we submitted the paper. We will cite this line of work in our final version. Below is a comparison between VAIN and Attention-based-Graph Neural Network.\n\nMain similarities and differences between VAIN and Attention-based Graph Neural Network (AGNN) are as follows:\n1. Experimental results: AGNN is tested on semi-supervised classification of nodes on a graph where as VAIN is tested on prediction of future state in multi-agent systems.\n\n2. Side information: AGNN is graph processing neural network, but VAIN model does not take graph as an input as initially proposed (although it could).  In VAIN, it is assumed that every agent can possibly interact with every other agent in the system. Where as in AGNN we have a known graph in which real world first order interaction between two nodes are represented as edges and attention is computed only for these first order interactions. VAIN clubs all the higher order (long range) interactions into a single attention mechanism, where as AGNN computes higher order interactions through multiple hops of first order attention mechanism.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Attention-based Graph Neural Network for Semi-supervised Learning","abstract":"Recently popularized graph neural networks achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy on a number of standard benchmark datasets for graph-based semi-supervised learning, improving significantly over existing approaches.
