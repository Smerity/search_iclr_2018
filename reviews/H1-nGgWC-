The result stated in this paper is proven by bounding the gap between the output distribution and the corresponding gaussian process, and by propagating this bound across layers (appendix). \nIn part 3, the authors discuss the choice of a nonlinearity function that enables easy computation of the kernels introduced in the covariance matrix of the limit normal distribution. Their choice lands on ReLU.\nIn part 4, the focus is on the speed of the convergence presented in theorem 1. Experiments are conducted to show how the distance (maximum mean disrepancy) between the output distribution and its theoretical gaussian process limit vary when the sizes of the hidden layers increase. The results show that the convergence (in MMD) happens consistently, although it is slower when the number of hidden layers gets bigger.\nIn part 5, the authors compare the distributions (finite Bayesian deep networks and their analogues Gaussian processes) in yet another way: by studying their agreement in terms of inference. For this purpose, the authors chose several crieteria: the first two moments of the posterior, the log marginal likelihood and the predictive log-likelihood. The authors judge that the distributions agree on those criteria, but do not provide further analysis.\nIn part 6, now that It has been shown that the output distributions of Bayesian neural nets do not only weakly converge to Gaussian processes but also behave similarly in terms of inference, the authors discuss ways to avoid the gaussian process behaviour. Indeed, it seems that Gaussian processes with a fixed kernel cannot learn hierarchical representations, that are essential in deep learning.\nThe idea to avoid the Gaussian process behaviour is to contradict one of the hypothesis of the CLT (so that it does not hold anymore), either by controlling the size of intermediate layers, by using networks with infinite variance in the activities, or by choosing non-independent weights.\nIn part 7, it is concluded that the result that has been proven for size of layers going to infinity (Theorem 1) seems to empirically be verified on finite networks similar to those used in the literature. This can be used to simplify inference in cases were the gaussian process behaviour is desired, and opens questions on how to avoid this behaviour the rest of the time.\n\nPros: The authors line of thought of the authors is overall quite easy to follow. The main theoretical convergence result is stated early on, and the remaining of the article is dedicated to observing this result empirically from different angles (MMD, inference, predictive capability..). The last part contains a discussion concerning the extent to which it is actually a desired or a undesired result in classical deep learning use-cases, and the authors provide intuitive conditions under which the convergence would not hold. The stated theorem is a clear improvement on the past literature and is promising in a context where multi-layers neural networks are more and more studied.\nFinally, the work is well documented.\n\nCons: \nI have a some concerns with the main result (Theorem 1) and found that some of the notations / formulas were not very clear.\n Concerns with Theorem 1:\n* at the end of the proof of Lemma 2, H_\\mu is to be chosen large enough in order to get the \\epsilon bound of the statement. However, I think that  H_\\mu is constrained by the statement of Proposition 2, not to be larger than a constant times 2^(H_{\\mu+1}). Isn't that a problem?\n* In the proof of Lemma 4, it looks like matrix \\Psi, from the schur decomposition of \\tilde f, actually depends on H_{\\mu-2}, thus making \\psi_max depend on it too, as well as the final \\beta bound, which would contradict the statement that it depends only on n and H_{\\mu}. Could you please double check?\n\nUnclear statements/notations:\n* end of page 3, notations are not entirely consist with previous notations\n* I do not understand which distribution is assumed on epsilon and gamma when taking the expectancy in equation (9).\n* the notation x^(i) (in the theorem and the proof notably) could be changed, for the ^(i) index refers to the depth of the layer in the rest of the notations, and is here surprisingly referring to a set of observations.\n* the statement of Theorem 1:\n    * I would change \"for a countable input set\" to \"for any countable input set\", if this holds true.\n    * does not say that the width has to go to infinity for the convergence to happen, which goes a bit in contradiction with the adjective \"wide\". However, the authors say that in practice, they use the identity as width function.\n* I understood that the conclusion of part 3 was that the expectation of eq (9) was elegantly computable for certain non-linearity (including ReLU). However I don't see the link with the \"recursive kernel\" idea (maybe it's just the way to do the computation described in Cho&Saul(2009) ?)\n\nSome places where it appears that there are minor mistakes:\n* 7th line from the bottom of page 3, the vector f^{(2)}(x) contains f_i^{(1)}(x) but should contain f_i^{(2)}(x)\n* last display of page 3: change x and x', and indicate upper limit of the sum\n* please double check variances C_w and/or \\hat{C}_w appearing in equations in (9) and (13).\n* line 2 of second paragraph after equations (8) and (9). The authors refer to equation (8) concerning the independence of the components of the output. I think they rather wanted to refer to (9). Same for first sentence before eq (14).\n* middle of page 12: matrix LY should be RY.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Gaussian Process Behaviour in Wide Deep Neural Networks","abstract":"Whilst deep neural networks have shown great empirical success, there is still much work to be done to understand their theoretical properties.

This result, which was well known for single-layer NNs, is now extended to the multilayer case. Although there was already previous work suggesting GP this behavior, there was no formal proof under the specific conditions presented here.\n\nThe convergence to a GP is also verified experimentally on some toy examples.\n\n\n- Relevance\n\nThe result itself does not feel very novel because variants of it were already available.\n\nUnfortunately, although making other researchers aware of this is worthy, the application of this result seems limited, since in fact it describes and lets us know more about a regime that we would rather avoid, rather than one we want to exploit. Most of the applications of deep learning benefit from strong structured priors that cannot be represented as a GP. This is properly acknowledged in the paper.\n\nThe lack of practical relevance combined with the not-groundbreaking novelty of the result makes this paper less appealing.\n\n\n- Other comments\n\nPage 6: \"It does mean however that our empirical study does not extend to larger datasets where such inference is prohibitively expensive (...) prior dominated problems are generally regarded as an area of strength for Bayesian approaches and in this context our results are directly relevant.\"\n\nAlthough that argument can hold for datasets that are large in terms of amount of data points, it doesn't for datasets that are large in terms of number of dimensions. The empirical study could have used very high-dimensional datasets with comparatively low amounts of training data. That would maintain a regime were the prior does matter but and better show the generality of the results.\n\nPage 6: \"We use rectified linear units and correct the variances to avoid a loss of prior variance as depth is increased as discussed in Section 3\" \n\nAre you sure this is discussed in Section 3?\n\nPage 4: \"This is because for finite H the input activations do not have a multivariate normal distribution\". \n\nCan you elaborate on this?

This work is a nice follow up to Neal (1994), and recent work considering similar results for neural networks with more than one hidden layer. It does add to our understanding of this body of work.\n\nThe weakness of this paper is in its significance and practical value. This infinite limit loses much of the interesting representation in neural networks because the variance of the weights goes to zero. Thus it’s unclear whether these formulations will have many of the benefits of standard neural networks, and whether they’re particularly related to standard neural networks at all. There also don’t seem to be many practical takeaways from the experiments, and the experiments themselves do not consider any predictive tasks at all. It would be nice to see some practical benefit for a predictive task actually demonstrated in the paper. I am not sure what exactly I would do differently in training large neural networks based on the results of this paper, and the possible takeaways are not tested here on real applications.\n\nThis paper also seems to erroneously attribute this limitation of the Neal (1994) limit, and its multilayer extensions, to Gaussian processes in the section “avoiding Gaussian process behaviour”. The problems with that construction are not a profound limitation of Gaussian processes in general. If we can learn the kernel function, then we can learn an interesting representation that does not have these limitations and still use a GP. We could alternatively treat the kernel parameters probabilistically, but the fact that in this case we would not marginally have a GP any longer is mostly incidental. The discussed limitations are more about specific kernel choices, and lack of kernel learning, than about “GP behaviour”.\n\nIndeed, while the discussion of related work is mostly commendable, the authors should also discuss the recent papers on “deep kernel learning”:\ni) http://proceedings.mlr.press/v51/wilson16.pdf\nii) https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6426-stochastic-variational-deep-kernel-learning.pdf\niii) http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-498/16-498.pdf\n\nIn particular, these papers do indeed learn flexible representations with Gaussian processes by using kernels constructed with neural networks. They avoid the behaviour discussed in the last section of your paper, but still use a Gaussian process. The network structures themselves are trained through the marginal likelihood of the Gaussian process. This approach effectively learns an infinite number of adaptive basis functions, parametrized through the structural properties of a neural network. Computations are made scalable and practical through exploiting algebraic structure. \n\t\t\t\nOverall I enjoyed reading your paper.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Gaussian Process Behaviour in Wide Deep Neural Networks","abstract":"Whilst deep neural networks have shown great empirical success, there is still much work to be done to understand their theoretical properties.
