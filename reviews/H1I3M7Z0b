The paper is clearly written and results seem compelling but on a pretty restricted domain which is not well known. This could have significance if it applies more generally.\n\nWhy does it work so well?

The method combined with weight quantization provides 180x compression with a very small accuracy drop. \n\nThe method is novel  and tested on multiple audio classification datasets and results show a good compression ratio with a negligible accuracy drop.  The organization of the paper is good. However, it is a bit difficult to understand the method. Figure 1 does not help much.

When combined with quantization, the proposed approach allows for large compression ratios with minimal loss in performance on various audio classification tasks. Although the results are interesting, I have a number of concerns about this work, which are listed below:\n\n1. The idea of tying weights in the neural network in order to compress the model is not entirely new. This has been proposed previously in the context of feed-forward networks [1], and convolutional networks [2] where the choice of parameter tying is based on hash functions which ensure a random (but deterministic) mapping from a small set of “true” weights to a larger set of “virtual” weights. I think it would be more fair to compare against the HashedNet technique.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Wenlin Chen, James T. Wilson, Stephen Tyree, Kilian Q. Weinberger, and Yixin Chen. 2015.

Given that the experiments are conducted on tasks where there isn’t a large amount of training data, one concern is that the baseline model used by the authors might be overparameterized. It would be interesting to see how performance varies as a function of number of parameters for these tasks without any “compression”, i.e., just by reducing filter sizes, for example.\n\n3. It seems somewhat surprising that repeating the filter weights across channels as is done in the channel sharing technique yields no loss in accuracy, especially for the deeper convolutional layers. Could this perhaps be a function of the tasks that the binary “music detection” task that these models are evaluated on? Do the authors have any comments on why this doesn't hurt performance?\n\n4. In citing relevant previous work, the authors should also include student-teacher approaches [1, 2] and distillation [3], and work by Denil et al. [4] on compression.\nReferences:\n[1] C. Bucilua, R.

Section 3, where the authors describe the proposed techniques is somewhat confusing to read, because of a lack of detailed mathematical explanations of the proposed techniques. This makes the paper harder to understand, in my view. Please re-write these sections in order to clearly express the parameter tying mechanism. In particular, I had the following questions:\n- Are weights tied across layers i.e., are the “weight sharing” matrices shared across layers?\n- There appears to be a typo in Equation 3: I believe it should be m = m* C.\n- Filter augmentation/Weight quantization are applicable to all methods, including the baseline. It would therefore be interesting to examine how they affect the baseline, not just the proposed system.\n- Section 3.5, on using the “Integral Image” to speed up computation was not clear to me. In particular, could the authors re-write to explain how the computation is computed efficiently with “two subtraction operations”. Could the authors also clarify the savings achieved by this technique?\n\n6. Results are reported on the various test sets without any discussion of statistical significance. Could the authors describe whether the differences in performance on the various test sets are statistically significant?\n\n7. On the ESC-50, UrbanSound8K, and DCASE tasks, it is a bit odd to compare against previous baselines which use different input features, use different model configurations, etc. It would be much better to use one of the previously published configurations as the baseline, and apply the proposed techniques to that configuration to examine performance. In particular, could the authors also use log-Mel filterbank energies as input features similar to (Piczak, 2015) and (Salomon and Bello, 2015), and apply the proposed techniques starting from those input features? Also, it would be useful when comparing against previously published baselines to indicate total number of independent parameters in the system in addition to accuracy numbers.\n\n8.
