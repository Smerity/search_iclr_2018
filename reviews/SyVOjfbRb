We still try our best to respond to concerns. \n\n1)   SGD reduces the costly iteration (O(1) per iteration) but increases the number of iterations. Any known adaptive scheme to reduce the number of iterations leads to very costly O(N) per iteration. We refer this inherent tradeoff as chicken and egg loop. If this is a big issue, we can easily change it?  \n\n2) See response to AnonReviewer1. Missing the subtlety of the algorithm is easy. Simplicity that beats a fundamental barrier is rare and most exciting. \n\n3)  The theorems are valid for any LSH irrespective of the choice of similarity, similar to why importance sampling is unbiased for any proposal.  So we don't really see what the issue is. \n\n4) see 1\n\n5) We will proofread the paper. Thanks for pointing out. \n\nWe hope that our comments will change the opinion of the reviewer. We are happy to have any more suggestions. \nThanks for the time in providing feedback.

Since hashing schemes essentially reduce the dimension, LSH brings computational benefits to the SGD operation. The targeted issue is fundamentally important, and the proposed approach (exploiting LSH schemes) seems to be sound.  Specifically, LSH schemes fit into the SGD schemes since they hash two vectors to the same bucket with probability in proportional to their distance (here, inner product or Cosine similarity).\n\nStrengths:  a sound approach; a simple and straightforward idea that is shown to work well in evaluations.\n\nWeaknesses: \n1. The phrase of \"computational chicken-and-egg loop\" in the title and also in the main body is misleading and not accurate. The so-called \"chicken-and-egg” issue concerns the causality dilemma: two causally related things, which comes the first. In the paper, the authors concerned \"more accurate gradients\" and \"faster convergence\"; their causality is very clear (the first leads to the second), and there is no causality dilemma. Even from a computational perspective, \"SDG schemes aim for computational efficiency\" and \"stochastic makes the convergence slow down\" are not a causality dilemma.  The reason behind is that the latter is the cost of the first one, just the old saying that \"there is no such thing as a free lunch\". Therefore, this disordered logic makes the title very misleading, and all the corresponding descriptions in the main body are obscured by \"twisted\" and unnatural logics. \n \n2. The depth is so limited. Besides a good observation that LSH fits well into SDG, there are no more in-depth results provided. The theorems (Theorems 1~3) are trivial, with loose relations with LSH.\n\t \n3. The LSH schemes are not correctly referred to. Since the similarity metric is inner-product, the authors are expected to refer to Cosine similarity and inner-product based LSHs, which were published recently in NIPS. It is not in depth to assume \"any known LSH scheme\" in Alg. 2. Accordingly again, Theorems 1~3 are unrelated with this specific kind of similarity metric (Cosine similarity).\n\n4. As the authors tried hard to stick to the unnecessary (a bit bragging) phrase \"computational chicken-and-egg loop\", the organization and presentation of the whole manuscript are poor.\n\n5. Occasionally, there are typos, and it is not good to use words in formulas.
