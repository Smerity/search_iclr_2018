All experiments were performed in an off-policy setting. This decision was made due to the higher sample-efficiency of the off-policy methods.\n\n- Figure 4b needs the colors to be labeled.

In fact, it will be easier to implement our approach in the on-policy setup. The off-policy setup with experience replay that we are considering requires additional care due to the embedding variable which we also maintain in the replay buffer. In Section 5, we present all the modifications necessary to running our method in the more data-efficient off-policy setup, which we believe is crucial to running it on the real robots in the future.\n\nWe would also like to thank the reviewer for pointing out the additional references - we will be very happy to include them. While some of the high-level ideas are related, there are differences both in the formulation and the algorithmic framework. An important aspect of our work is that we show how to apply entropy-regularized RL with latent variables when working with neural networks and in an off-policy setting, avoiding both the burden of using a limited number of hand-crafted features and allowing for data-efficient learning.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Learning an Embedding Space for Transferable Robot Skills","abstract":"We present a method for reinforcement learning of closely related skills that are parameterized via a skill embedding space.

The paper uses a variational bound for entropy regularized RL to learn a versatile latent space which represents the skill to execute. The variational bound is used to diversify the learned skills as well as to make the skills identifyable from their state trajectories. The algorithm is tested on a simple point mass task and on simulated robot manipulation tasks.\n\nThis is a very intersting paper which is also very well written. I like the presented approach of learning the skill embeddings using the variational lower bound. It represents one of the most principled approches for hierarchical RL. \n\nPros: \n- Interesting new approach for hiearchical reinforcement learning that focuses on skill versatility\n- The variational lower bound is one of the most principled formulations for hierarchical RL that I have seen so far\n- The results are convincing\n\nCons:\n- More comparisons against other DRL algorithms such as TRPO and PPO would be useful\n\nSummary: This is an interesting deep reinforcement learning paper that introduces a new principled framework for learning versatile skills.
