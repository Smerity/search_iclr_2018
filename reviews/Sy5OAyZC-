We totally agree that sequence tagging should be a very important NLP problem to be considered, which could make the systematic comparisons in our paper more diverse and comprehensive. In this regard, we have tried on two (structured) sequence tagging tasks (i.e. chunking, NER). Specifically, we have considered the standard CoNLL2000 chunking and CoNLL2003 NER datasets. The corresponding results (F1 score) are shown as below:\n\n    Dataset              CNN-CRF [1]         BI-LSTM-CRF [2]        SWEM-CRF\n\nCoNLL2000                  94.32                      94.46                         90.34\n\nCoNLL2003                  89.59                      90.10                         86.28\n\nSWEM-CRF indicates that CRF is directly operated on top of the word embedding layer and make predictions for each word (there is no contextual/word-order information before CRF layer, compared to CNN-CRF or BI-LSTM-CRF). As shown above, CNN-CRF and BI-LSTM-CRF consistently outperform SWEM-CRF on both sequence tagging tasks, although the training takes around 4 to 5 times longer (for BI-LSTM-CRF) than SWEM-CRF. This suggests that for chunking and NER, compositional functions such as LSTM or CNN are very necessary, because of the sequential (order-sensitive) nature of sequence tagging tasks. \n\nOne interesting future direction is to design some models that are simple yet still effective at capturing the contextual information needed for sequence tagging tasks. [3] is a great work along this line, which has proposed a simple and fast model for NER based on FOFE. We thank you again for pointing out the FOFE paper! \n\nAll told: again, thanks for the helpful, critical feedback! We think that the paper, with these additional results, should have much more general implications in NLP than it was on submission, and sincerely hope you will agree.\n\n\n[1] Collobert, Ronan, et al. \"Natural language processing (almost) from scratch.\" Journal of Machine Learning Research 12.Aug (2011): 2493-2537.\n[2] Huang, Zhiheng, Wei Xu, and Kai Yu. \"Bidirectional LSTM-CRF models for sequence tagging.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1508.01991 (2015).\n[3] Xu, Mingbin, and Hui Jiang. \"A FOFE-based Local Detection Approach for Named Entity Recognition and Mention Detection.\" ACL 2017.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"On the Use of Word Embeddings Alone to Represent Natural Language Sequences","abstract":"To construct representations for natural language sequences, information from two main sources needs to be captured: (i) semantic meaning of individual words, and (ii) their compositionality.

We specifically mentioned in the introduction part that most of our comparisons were considering one-layer recurrent/convolutional models (except for document classification tasks where deep models’ results were available). Besides, although fasttext and Parikh’s results have manifested the advantages of simpler model on certain tasks, there were hundreds of recent papers on text representation learning that were based on LSTM or CNN compositional functions, without comparisons to simpler methods. In this regard, the general trade-offs among different compositional functions have not been widely recognized yet. There is a clear gap here for research.\n\nMore importantly, the motivations of the two papers you mentioned are different from ours. As a result, we have presented a much more comprehensive investigation regarding the necessity of employing complicated compositional functions (LSTM or CNN) and have answered many research questions they did not discuss: when (on what type of tasks) do simpler methods work better? When are CNN or LSTM-based models necessary?  Why are the advantages provided by complicated compositional functions so limited on tasks such as text matching or document categorization, in other words, why are simpler methods so efficient on these problems? Neither the fasttext paper nor Parikh’s work has explored these interesting questions.\n\nBesides, from Parikh’s results, we cannot directly draw the conclusion that simplicity is better, because the superior results they got may stem from the fact that the compare-aggregate framework they proposed is very efficient, which has made LSTM or CNN unnecessary. Moreover, they have only shown results on SNLI dataset, so that their observations may not apply to other text matching problems in general (e.g. paraphrase identification, answer sentence selection).\n\nMoreover, fasttext and our SWEM variants all belong to the category of simpler methods (with parameter-free compositional functions). Since our motivation is to explore the necessity of employing complicated compositional functions for various NLP tasks, we do not think it is necessary for us to make any comparisons between fasttext and SWEM.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"On the Use of Word Embeddings Alone to Represent Natural Language Sequences","abstract":"To construct representations for natural language sequences, information from two main sources needs to be captured: (i) semantic meaning of individual words, and (ii) their compositionality.

For example, as shown in Figure 2, for both Yahoo! Ans and SNLI datasets, SWEM consistently performs much better than CNN or LSTM on the wide range of 0.1% ~ 10% proportion of original training data. With the whole training set, SWEM typically performs comparable or a bit better than LSTM or CNN on text matching and document topic prediction tasks. This indicates that SWEM is much less likely to overfit with limited training observations. \n\nFor LSTM and CNN, most of our results are directly used from previous literature wherever available. As to SWEM, there are not much hyperparameters to be tuned thanks to its simplicity and our reported results are quite robust to the selection of hyperparameters. We will make our code publicly available after publication. \n\nThe reasons that SWEM outperforms LSTM or CNN in some cases could be two-fold: 1) as already discussed in the paper, because of the simplicity, SWEM could be much easier to be optimized and thus may converge to some better local optima; 2) as suggested in [1], simpler methods tend to be better at capturing semantics than RNN’s and LSTM’s, although ignoring word-order information. Therefore, for datasets where word-order information is not important (such as Yahoo! Ans or SNLI), directly optimizing the word embeddings (semantics), as in SWEM, could be a better strategy.\n\n[1] Arora, Sanjeev, Yingyu Liang, and Tengyu Ma. \"A simple but tough-to-beat baseline for sentence embeddings.\" (2016).\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"On the Use of Word Embeddings Alone to Represent Natural Language Sequences","abstract":"To construct representations for natural language sequences, information from two main sources needs to be captured: (i) semantic meaning of individual words, and (ii) their compositionality.

From this perspective, there is not much work that has investigated the trade-offs among different compositional functions. Our work aims to understand this important research problem with solid experiments and careful analysis.\n\nThus, the motivation of our paper is not to claim that we develop a new model/algorithm, but to discuss/understand the general trade-offs stated above and to answer the following research questions: when is it necessary to employ more complicated compositional function, such as LSTM or CNN, for various NLP tasks?

More importantly, our work also sheds lights on how SWEM model works and what types of information are needed for distinct tasks. Therefore, we suppose that our conclusions here should be helpful and general in many cases of interest. \n\nFor example, if we are solving a text sequence matching problem where word-order information does not contribute a lot (including textual entailment, paraphrase identification, question answering), according to our research, we would know that employing complicated compositions, such as LSTM or CNN, may not be necessary. In this regard, our work reveals several general rules (along with careful analysis) on rationally selecting model for various NLP tasks, which should be useful for future research. \n\n- “Interpretability” definition: we think that there are some misunderstandings here. The key of our “interpretability” here is that we can endow each dimension of word embeddings, learned by SWEM-max, with a topic-specific meaning. That is, embeddings for individual words with a shared semantic topic typically have their largest values in a shared dimension. \n\nWe are aware that word embeddings, such as Word2vec, can also be interpreted with some simple vector arithmetics (e.g. element-wise addition), but we suppose that the property of word vectors mentioned above could be an even more straightforward interpretation regarding how information has been encoded in word vectors. This type of “interpretability” has been previously discussed in [1, 2].\n\n- FOFE model: Thanks for pointing out this inspiring reference. The idea of employing a constant forgetting factor to model word-order information is very interesting. In this regard, we implemented the FOFE model and tested it on both Yahoo and Yelp Polarity datasets. We experimented with different choice of the constant forgetting factor (\\alpha):\n\n\\alpha                 0.9        0.99      0.999     0.9999       1.0       SWEM-aver   SWEM-concat\nYelp P.              84.58     93.01      93.81     93.79       93.48          93.59               93.76\nYahoo! Ans      72.66     72.72     73.03      72.82       72.97         73.14                73.53\n\nIt is worth noting that when \\alpha = 1, FOFE is very similar to SWEM-aver model, except the fact that FOFE takes the sum over all words, rather than average. As shown above, with a careful selection of \\alpha, FOFE can get slightly better performance on Yelp dataset (with \\alpha = 0.999), compared to SWEM-concat. While on Yahoo dataset, we do not observe significant performance gains with the FOFE model. These results are in consistent with our observations that word-order features are necessary for sentiment analysis, but not for topic prediction. We will include this reference and the additional results in the revised version. \n\nBesides, we totally agree that developing sentence embeddings that are both simple and efficient is a very promising research direction (FOFE is a great work along this line).\n\n- Thanks for pointing out the wording and format issue. We will fix them accordingly in the revision.\n\nHopefully our clarifications could address the concerns and questions raised in your review.

The evidence here is two-fold: first, for Yelp review datasets, the text sequences considered are also long documents. However, since word-order features are necessary for sentiment analysis tasks (as demonstrated from multiple perspectives in the paper), CNN or LSTM has shown better results than SWEM. This indicates that even in the case of modeling longer text, LSTM and CNN could potentially take advantage of compositional (word-order) features if necessary. Second, we did observe that there are typically multiple key words (i.e. predictive independent cues) in a longer text for prediction, especially in the case of topic predictions (where the key words could be very topic-specific). This may intuitively explain why compositions are not necessary for document categorization.\n\n- Thanks for suggesting this! We agree that including a linear classifier comparison would be useful. In this regard, we trained and tested our SWEM-concat model along with a linear classifier (denoted as SWEM-linear), the results are shown as below (word embeddings are initialized from GloVe and directly updated during training): \n\nModel                           Yahoo!

This observation highlights that SWEM model is able to extract robust and informative sentence representations.\n\n- It is quite necessary to fine-tune the GloVe embeddings. As discussed in the paper, an intrinsic difference between GloVe and SWEM-learned embeddings is that the latter are very sparse. This is closely related to the fact that SWEM is utilizing the key words to make predictions. As a result, we would need to update GloVe embeddings or transform them to another space to boost the model performance. At the same time, we also found that for large-scale datasets (such as Yahoo or Yelp dataset), initializing with GloVe does not contribute a lot to the final results (i.e. randomly initializing the word embeddings leads to similar performance).\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"On the Use of Word Embeddings Alone to Represent Natural Language Sequences","abstract":"To construct representations for natural language sequences, information from two main sources needs to be captured: (i) semantic meaning of individual words, and (ii) their compositionality.

Average and/or max pooling over word embeddings (which are initialized from pretrained embeddings) is used to obtain a fixed-length representation for natural language sequences, which is then fed through a single layer MLP classifier. In many of the 9 evaluation tasks, this approach is found to match or outperform single-layer CNNs or RNNs.\n\nThe varied findings are very clearly presented and helpfully summarized, and for each task setting the authors perform an insightful analysis.\n\nMy only criticism would be the fact that the study is limited to English, even though the conclusions are explicitly scoped in light of this. Moreover, I wonder how well the findings would hold in a setting with a more severe OOV problem than is perhaps present in the studied datasets.\n\nBesides concluding from the presented results that these SWEMs should be considered a strong baseline in future work, one might also conclude that we need more challenging datasets!\n\nMinor things:\n- It wasn't entirely clear how the text matching tasks are encoded. Are the two sequences combined into a single sequence before applying the model, or something else? I might have missed this detail.\n\n- Given the two ways of using the Glove embeddings for initialization (direct update vs mapping them with an MLP into the task space), it would be helpful to know which one ended up being used (i.e. optimal) in each setting.\n\n- Something went wrong with the font size for the remainder of the text near Figure 1.\n\n** Update **\nThanks for addressing my questions in the author response.\n\nAfter following the other discussion thread about the novelty claims, I believe I didn't weigh that aspect strongly enough in my original rating, so I'm revising it. I remain of the opinion that this paper offers a useful systematic comparison that goes sufficiently beyond the focus of the two related papers mentioned in that thread (fasttext and Parikh's).\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"On the Use of Word Embeddings Alone to Represent Natural Language Sequences","abstract":"To construct representations for natural language sequences, information from two main sources needs to be captured: (i) semantic meaning of individual words, and (ii) their compositionality.

That is, the authors seek to explore the advantages afforded by RNN/CNN based models that induce intermediate semantic representations of texts, as opposed to simpler (parameter-free) approaches to composing these, like addition. \n\nIn sum, I think this is exploration is interesting, and suggests that we should perhaps experiment more regularly with simple aggregation methods like SWEM. On the other hand, the differences across the models is relatively modest, and the data resists clear conclusions, so I'm not sure that the work will be very impactful. In my view, then, this work does constitute a contribution, albeit a modest one. I do think the general notion of attempting to simplify models until performance begins to degrade is a fruitful path to explore, as models continue to increase in complexity despite compelling evidence that this is always needed.\n\nStrengths\n---\n+ This paper does highlight a gap in existing work, as far as I am aware: namely, I am not sure that there are generally known trade-offs associated with different compositional models over token embeddings for NLP. However, it is not clear that we should expect there to be a consistent result to this question across all NLP tasks.\n\n+ The results are marginally surprising, insofar as I would have expected the CNN/RNN (particularly the former) to dominate the simpler aggregation approaches, and this does not seem borne out by the data. Although this trend is seemingly reversed on the short text data, muddying the story. \n\nWeaknesses\n---\n- There are a number of important limitations here, many of which the authors themselves note, which mitigate the implications of the reported results. First, this is a small set of tasks, and results may not hold more generally. It would have been nice to see some work on Seq2Seq tasks, or sequence tagging tasks at least. \n\n- I was surprised to see no mention of the \"Fixed-Size Ordinally-Forgetting Encoding Method\" (FOFE) proposed by Zhang et al. in 2015, which would seem to be a natural point of comparison here, given that it sits in a sweet spot of being simple and efficient while still expressive enough to preserve word-order information. This actually seems like a pretty glaring omission given that it meets many of the desiderata the authors put forward. \n\n- The interpretability angle discussed seems underdeveloped. I'm not sure that being able to identify individual words (as the authors have listed) meaningfully constitutes \"interpretability\" -- standard CNNs, e.g., lend themselves to this as well by tracing back through the filter activations. \n\n- Some of the questions addressed seem tangential to the main question of the paper -- e.g., word vector dimensionality seems an orthogonal issue to the composition function, and would influence performance for the more complex architectures as well.\n\nSmaller comments\n---\n- On page 1, the authors write \"By representing each word as a fixed-length vector, these embeddings can group semantically similar words, while explicitly encoding rich linguistic regularities and patterns\", but actually I would say that these *implicitly* encode such regularities, rather than explicitly. \n\n- \"architecture in Kim 2014; Collobert et al. 2011; Gan et al. 2017\" -- citation formatting a bit weird here.\n\n\n*** Update based on author response *** \n\nI have read the authors response and thank them for the additional details. \n\nRegarding the limited set of problems: of course any given work can only explore so many tasks, but for this to have general implications in NLP I would maintain that a standard (structured) sequence tagging task/dataset should have been considered. This is not about the number of datasets, but rather than diversity of the output spaces therein.\n\nI appreciated the additional details regarding FOFE, which as the authors themselves note in their response is essentially a generalization of SWEM. \n\nOverall, the response has not changed my opinion on this paper: I think this (exploring simple representations and baselines) is an important direction in NLP, but feel that the paper would greatly benefit from additional work.\n\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":3,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"On the Use of Word Embeddings Alone to Represent Natural Language Sequences","abstract":"To construct representations for natural language sequences, information from two main sources needs to be captured: (i) semantic meaning of individual words, and (ii) their compositionality.
