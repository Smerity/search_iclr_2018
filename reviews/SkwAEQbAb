The paper is insufficiently contratested existing literature.","rating":"3: Clear rejection","review":"The authors propose the use of bootstrapping the data (random sampling entries with replacement) to form surrogate data for which they can evaluate the singular value spectrum of the SVD of the matrix to the singular values of the bootstrapped data, thereby determining the number of latent dimensions in PCA by the point in which the singular values are no greater than the bootstrapped sampled values.  The procedure is contrasted to some existing methods for determining the number of latent components and found to perform similarly to another procedure based on bootstrapping correlation matrices, the PA procedure.\n\nPros:\nDetermining the number of components is an important problem that the authors here address.\n\nCons:\nI find the paper poorly written and the methodology not sufficiently rooted in the existing literature. There are many approaches to determining the number of latent components in PCA that needs to be discussed and constrasted including:\nCross-validation:\nhttp://scholar.google.dk/scholar_url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.academia.edu%2Fdownload%2F43416804%2FGeneralizable_Patterns_in_Neuroimaging_H20160306-9605-1xf9c9h.pdf&hl=da&sa=T&oi=gga&ct=gga&cd=0&ei=rjkXWrzKKImMmAH-xo7gBw&scisig=AAGBfm2iRQhmI2EHEO7Cl6UZoRbfAxDRng&nossl=1&ws=1728x1023\nVariational Bayesian PCA:\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/variational-principal-components/\nFurthermore, the idea of bootstrapping for the SVD has been discussed in prior publications and the present work need to be related to these prior works.

In fact, it seems bootstrapping the correlation matrix has a very similar effect as the proposed bootstrapping procedure. Thus, it seems the proposed procedure which is very similar in spirit to PA does not have much benefit over this procedure.\n\nMinor comments:\nExplain what SW abbreviates when introduced first.\nWe will see that it PA a close relationship with BSVD-> We will see that PA is closely related to BSVD\n\nmore effective than SVD under certain conditions (?). – please provide reference instead of ?\n\nBut table 4 that shows -> But table 4 shows that\n\nWe can sum up with that the result seems ->To summarize, the result seems\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"A novel method to determine the number of latent dimensions with SVD","abstract":"Determining the number of latent dimensions is a ubiquitous problem in machine\nlearning.

Some of the more obvious issues, each alone sufficient for rejection, include:\n\n1. Discrepancy between motivation and actual work. The method is specifically about determining the rank of a matrix, but the authors motivate it with way too general and vague relationships, such as \"determining the number of nodes in neural networks\". Somewhat oddly, the problem is highlighted to be of interest in supervised problems even though one would expect it to be much more important in unsupervised ones.\n\n2. Complete lack of details for related work. Methods such as PA and MAP are described with vague one-sentences summaries that tell nothing about how they actually work. There would have been ample space to provide the mathematical formulations.\n\n3. No technical contribution. The proposed method is trivial variant of randomised testing, described with single sentence \"Bootstrapped samples R_B are simply generated through random sampling with replacement of the values of R.\" with literally no attempt of providing any sort of justification why this kind of random sampling would be good for the proposed task or what kind of assumptions it builds on.\n\n4. Poor experiments using really tiny artificial data sets, reported in unprofessional manner (visual style in plots changes from figure to figure, tables report irrelevant numbers in hard-to-read format etc). No real improvement over the somewhat random choice of comparison methods that do not even represent the techniques people would typically use for this problem.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"A novel method to determine the number of latent dimensions with SVD","abstract":"Determining the number of latent dimensions is a ubiquitous problem in machine\nlearning.
