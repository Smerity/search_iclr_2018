We have incorporated all of them in our updated paper plus additional proofreading. The following are our attempts to answer your questions.\n\n1. “. The problem being solved is not literally the problem of decreasing the amount of data needed to learn tasks, but a reformulation of the problem that makes it unnecessary to relearn subtasks. That's a good idea, but problem reformulation is always hard to justify without returning to a higher level of abstraction to justify that there's a deeper problem that remains unchanged.  ”\n\nWe will try to address this concern but we are not certain that we’ve fully understood it. We provide solutions to two problems in this paper, the first is to use the FSA augmented MDP to impose hierarchical structure/constraint to the original MDP and by doing so enhance the sample efficiency and interpretability of policy learning using existing RL methods. The second is to take advantage of the structure of product automatons to compose new policy from existing policies. We didn’t intentionally try to reformulate the problem but rather to incorporate the extra knowledge and structure provided by temporal logic and FSA into the original problem and proposed methods to ensure that this incorporation is helpful to the learning process.\n\n2. “The idea of using task decomposition to create intrinsic rewards seems really interesting, but does not appear to be explored in any depth. Are there theorems to be had? Is there a connection to subtasks rewards in earlier HRL papers?”\n\nThe reasoning behind the construction of the intrinsic reward ($D^1_\\phi$ in Definition 3) is to encourage the system to exit the current automaton state and eventually reach the final acceptance state which satisfies the TLTL specification or result in the trap state which given a large terminal penalty restarts the episode. This is a property of the FSA and therefore we didn’t go into much depth (we added a reference in section 2.2 (Vasile 2017) that show the application of similar idea). \n\nAs far as we know, existing HRL methods require some kind of human effort to engineer the hierarchical structure into the learner. This ranges from explicitly defining the options (initial set, policy and terminal condition) in the original options paper to designing the finite state machine in HAM (hierarchies of abstract machines). More recent efforts have relaxed these requirements of defining what each option is and how they interact with each other and depend on the learning algorithm to figure out the specifics, however the user still has to define either the intrinsic motivation (such as the h-DQN by Kulkarni et al) or the number of options to discover (such as the option-critic framework by Bacon et al). Our work free the user from designing any of the above and utilize the FSA to provide hierarchical structure and motivation. Due to space constraints, a detailed literature review on HRL is not included.\n\n3. “The lack of completeness (definitions of tasks and robustness) also makes the paper less impactful than it could be.“\n\nWe originally included a reference to the paper containing the definition of robustness, but given that this has caused enough confusion, we have provided the full definition of the boolean and quantitative semantics along with small examples in Appendix E. We are not sure what exactly “definitions of tasks” stands for but we used TLTL formula as task specifications and examples of them are provided in Appendix A.\n\n4. “The paper needs to include SOME definition of robustness, even if it just informal. As it stands, it's not even clear if larger values are better or worse. (It would seem that *more* robustness is better than less, but the text says that lower values are chosen.)”\n\nThe higher the robustness the better satisfaction of the specification. The reason Equation (15) chooses the policy with lower robustness is because we are trying to maximize the minimum of two robustnesses (Equation (13)) with means we have to maximize the lower of the two, assuming that following each policy maximizes its own robustness at the step level (which is a limitation of the current method and discussed in the conclusion, we are working on improving this)."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"AUTOMATA GUIDED HIERARCHICAL REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FOR ZERO-SHOT SKILL COMPOSITION","abstract":"An obstacle that prevents the wide adoption of (deep) reinforcement learning (RL) in control systems is its need for a large number of interactions with the environment in order to master a skill.

The following are our attempts to answer your questions.\n\n1. “The idea of extracting policies corresponding to individual automaton states and making them into options seems novel, but it would be important to argue that those options are likely to be useful again under some task distribution”\n\nEach option that corresponds to an automaton state q satisfies the predicate defined by $D^q_\\phi$ (in Definition 3). Since the FSA for an LTL formula is constructed by the conjunction, disjunction, and negation of various predicates, the already learned options can be used as is or to construct policies that satisfy new LTL specifications given the state and action distributions remain the same. \n\n2. “Section 4:  How is \"as soon as possible\" encoded in this objective?”\n\nThis is our neglect in proofreading, but a discount factor in addition to the terminal reward are used to ensure “as soon as possible”. We’ve made this correction in our updated version\n\n\n3. “ What if phi_1 is o ((A v B) Until C) and phi_2 is o ((not A v B) Until C).   Let's assume that o(B Until C) is satisfiable, so the conjunction is satisfiable.  However, we may find policy pi_1 that makes A true and B false (in general, there is no single optimal policy) and find pi_2 that makes A false and B false, and it will not be possible to satisfy the phi_1 and phi_2 by switching between the policies. ”\n\n\nThis is a good example and we’ll try our best to clarify. Given the learning objective in Equation (7), if the initial condition doesn’t violate (A v B), then $pi_1$ will head for C while ensuring that (A v B) is satisfied along its path to making C true. A transition from A=true to B=true is possible if the shortest path to C requires so (shortest path is the result of the discount factor and terminal reward). If the initial position violates (A v B), then the episode restarts (results in the trap state). The same goes for $pi_2$. So for both $phi_1$ and $phi_2$, the goal is to quickly get to C while satisfying (A v B) and (not A v B) respectively. Under Definition 3, the optimal policies for $pi_1$ and $pi_2$ are unique. The necessary condition for $phi_1 ^ phi_2$ to be satisfiable is that the intersection of B and C is nonempty and the initial condition satisfies (A v B) ^ (not A v B) = B v (A ^ not A) = B.

By doing so, options can be easily learned and extracted from the flat policy without the need manually design the specifics of the hierarchy. The FSA that results from the TLTL formula does not only provide the extrinsic and intrinsic rewards but also the temporal constraints of how the task should proceed which is incorporated into the system dynamics in Equation (6).\n\n2. “The exact relationship between the logical formulas and the stochastic trajectories of the MDP is not described in detail here, but relies on a robustness metric, rho” and “ The robustness term rho is essential, but it is not defined”\n\nThank you for raising this concern, we’ve originally made a reference to the paper containing the definition of robustness in Section 2.1, but now we have also added the full definition in Appendix E.\n\n3. “The main problem with this paper is that the connections between the TLTL formulas and the conventional RL objectives are not made sufficiently clear.”\n\nWe try to make this connection in Definition 1 and Problem 1, specifically Equation (1) and Equation (5). The goal of conventional RL is to maximize the expected return, the goal of RL with TLTL specification is to maximize the expected satisfaction of the TLTL formula.\n\n4. “I was also confused by the notation $D_\\phi^q$, which was described but not defined”\n\n$D_\\phi^q$ is defined in Definition 3 in the text after Equation (7). An example is provided after Equation (8).\n\n5. “The fact that there may be many policies which satisfy a particular reward function (or TLTL formula) is ignored.  This means that skill composition that is proposed in this paper might be quite far from the best policy that could be learned directly from a single conjunctive TLTL formula.”\n\nThe optimal policy for the FSA augmented MDP is unique under the effect of a discount factor and the terminal reward (we carelessly neglected the discount factor during proofreading which is now added). The optimal policy should guide the system out of the current automaton state as fast as possible and towards the final accepting state. Therefore, given enough terminal motivation, the desired behavior is to find the shortest path to satisfying the specification at any given state. And the composed policy will also achieve this following the characteristics of the product automaton and the derivations in Section 5. However, if we assume no discount factor (discount=1), we end up with a set of (possibly infinite) satisfying policies. The composed policy will thus also be one of many satisfying policies that satisfies the conjunction of two TLTL specs. Depending on how hyperparameters are set, the composed policy is likely different from that learned directly from a single conjunctive TLTL formula, but their expected return will be the same (given the terminal rewards are set up to encourage the same behavior). Optimality aside, the goal of finding a satisfying policy given by Problem 1 and Problem 2 will be met. \n\n6. “It is unclear how this approach manages tradeoffs between objectives that are specified as a conjunction of TLTL goals. is it better to have a small probability of fulfilling all goals, or to prefer a high probability of fulfilling half the goals?  In short the learning objectives of the proposed composition algorithm are unclear after translation from TLTL formulas to rewards.”\n\nFor the skill composition part, the objective is to fulfill all goals and hence the conjunction. If we only want to fulfill a subset of all the goals, then a disjunction would be used and the policy switching scheme would be slightly different but easily adaptable (part of our on-going work). There is not the notion of probability and we hope to show that by using our method it can be guaranteed that the conjunctive goal is fulfilled given that each sub-policy can fulfill their own goal.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"AUTOMATA GUIDED HIERARCHICAL REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FOR ZERO-SHOT SKILL COMPOSITION","abstract":"An obstacle that prevents the wide adoption of (deep) reinforcement learning (RL) in control systems is its need for a large number of interactions with the environment in order to master a skill.

The combination of temporal logic formulas with reinforcement learning was developed previously in the literature, and the main contribution of this paper is for fast skill composition.  The system uses logic formulas in truncated linear temporal logic (TLTL), which lacks an Always operator and where the LTL formula (A until B) also means that B must eventually hold true. The temporal truncation also requires the use of a specialized MDP formulation with an explicit and fixed time horizon T.  The exact relationship between the logical formulas and the stochastic trajectories of the MDP is not described in detail here, but relies on a robustness metric, rho.  The main contributions of the paper are to provide a method that converts a TLTL formula that specifies a task into a reward function for a new augmented MDP (that can be used by a conventional RL algorithm to yield a policy), and a method for quickly combining two such formulas (and their policies) into a new policy.  The proposed method is evaluated on a small Markov chain and a simulated Baxter robot.\n\nThe main problem with this paper is that the connections between the TLTL formulas and the conventional RL objectives are not made sufficiently clear.  The robustness term rho is essential, but it is not defined.  I was also confused by the notation $D_\\phi^q$, which was described but not defined.

The set of techniques we provide allows for the convenient specification of tasks with logical expressions, learns hierarchical policies (meta-controller and low-level controllers) with well-defined intrinsic rewards using any RL methods and is able to construct new skills from existing ones without additional learning. We evaluate the proposed methods in a simple grid world simulation as well as simulation on a Baxter robot.
