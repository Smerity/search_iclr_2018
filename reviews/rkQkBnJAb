I searched for public implementations of Cramer GAN, and the best one I could find is this one: https://github.com/pfnet-research/chainer-gan-lib According to the inception scores reported here, our method performs much better than Cramer GAN.\n\n* We are in correspondence with the authors of Cramer GAN about the details of this conditional generation experiment. So far we have not yet been able to replicate their exact setup. We hope to be able to include this experiment in the paper soon. Related to what youâ€™re asking for, we have added an additional experiment to the paper investigating sample diversity and mode collapse in OT-GAN as compared to DCGAN (appendix D). What we find here is that DCGAN (as well as other variants of GAN) still shows mode collapse when training for longer periods of time. For OT-GAN we see no mode collapse, even when we keep training for a very long time. If we stop training DCGAN when the Inception score is maximal, we see no mode collapse, but the sample diversity is still lower than for OT-GAN (see figure 6).\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Improving GANs Using Optimal Transport","abstract":"We present Optimal Transport GAN (OT-GAN), a variant of generative adversarial nets minimizing a new metric measuring the distance between the generator distribution and the data distribution.

As shown in Figure 4, small batch sizes are less stable during training, although the results are still on par with previous work on GANs. For large models we can reach the large batch sizes required for optimal results by using more GPUs and/or GPUs with more memory. Many of the other recent SOTA works in GANs use even more time and compute than we do, but it is indeed a limitation of the method as clearly indicated in the paper. In the updated paper we have expanded our discussion of this experiment, the causes behind its result, and its practical importance.\n\n* Our transport cost depends on a critic neural network v, which embeds the images (generated and real) into a latent space. As long as this embedding is one-to-one / non-degenerate, the statistical consistency guarantees associated with minimizing energy distance carry over to our setting. When the critic v is learned adversarially, the embedding could potentially degenerate and we could lose these properties. In practice, we manage to avoid this by updating the generator more often than the critic. If the critic maps two distinct inputs to similar embeddings, the generator will take advantage of this, thereby putting pressure on the critic to adapt the embedding. An alternative solution we tried is to parameterize the critic using a RevNet (Gomez et al. 2017): This way the mapping is always one-to-one by construction. Although this also works, we found it to be unnecessary when updating the generator often enough. The updated paper includes additional discussion on this point, and it also includes a new experiment (appendix C) further investigating the importance of adversarially learning the transport cost.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Improving GANs Using Optimal Transport","abstract":"We present Optimal Transport GAN (OT-GAN), a variant of generative adversarial nets minimizing a new metric measuring the distance between the generator distribution and the data distribution.

We're currently working on updating the paper, but I wanted to send you a quick reply regarding the two points you have raised:\n\n* We have now run exactly the experiment you suggest, using cosine distance in the pixel space (or equivalently squared Euclidean distance with normalized vectors) instead of in the critic-space defined by v_eta. The maximum inception score we were able to achieve using this setup on CIFAR-10 was 4.93 (compared to 8.47 achieved using the DNN critic v_eta). You can download the corresponding samples here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/e27uqj6ah7j9avq/sample_pixel_space.png?dl=1 We will include the results of this experiment in the upcoming update of the paper.\n\n* There is indeed a close connection between energy distance and MMD. When the energy distance is generalized to other distances between individual samples it becomes equivalent to MMD. This is explained in the following work, among other places: Sejdinovic, Dino, Bharath Sriperumbudur, Arthur Gretton, and Kenji Fukumizu. \"Equivalence of distance-based and RKHS-based statistics in hypothesis testing.\" The Annals of Statistics (2013): 2263-2291.\nThe novel part of our proposed minibatch energy distance is that it further generalizes the energy distance from individual samples to minibatches. This makes it conceptually different from the existing literature, including Kim, Been, Rajiv Khanna, and Oluwasanmi O. Koyejo. \"Examples are not enough, learn to criticize! Criticism for interpretability.\" In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 2280-2288. 2016. (please let us know if you were referring to a different paper) Equivalently we can say our minibatch energy distance generalizes MMD from individual samples to minibatches, but we choose to take the energy distance perspective as it more closely connects to other work in this area (e.g. Cramer-GAN).

This makes a lot of sense. The paper makes some very good connections to the state of the art and those competing approaches. The proposal makes sense from the generative standpoint and it is clear from the paper that the key contribution is the design of the transport cost. I have two main remarks and questions.\n\n* Regarding the transport cost, the authors say that the Euclidean distance does not work well. Did they try to use normalised vectors with the squared Euclidean distance ? I am asking this question because solving the OT problem with cost defined as in c_eta is equivalent to using a *normalized squared* Euclidean distance in the feature space defined by v_eta. If the answer is yes and it did not work, then there is indeed a real contribution to using the DNN. Otherwise, the contribution has to be balanced. In either case, I would have been happy to see numbers for comparison.\n\n* The square mini batch energy distance looks very much like a maximum mean discrepancy criterion (see the work of A. Gretton), up to the sign, and also to regularised approached to MMD optimisation (see the paper of Kim, NIPS'16 and references therein). The MMD is the solution of an optimisation problem which, I suppose, has lots of connections with the dual Wasserstein GAN. The authors should elaborate on the relationships, and eventually discuss regularisation in this context.\n\n","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Improving GANs Using Optimal Transport","abstract":"We present Optimal Transport GAN (OT-GAN), a variant of generative adversarial nets minimizing a new metric measuring the distance between the generator distribution and the data distribution.
