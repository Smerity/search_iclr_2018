Actually I find the entire notion of an \"ideal\" prior under the GAN setting a bit strange. To start with, GAN is already training the generator G to match the induced P_G(x) (from P(z)) with P_d(x), and hence by definition, under the generator G, there should be no better prior than P(z) itself (because any change of P(z) would then induce a different P_G(x) and hence only move away from the learning target).\n\nI get it that maybe under different P(z) the difficulty of learning a good generator G can be different, and therefore one may wish to iterate between updating G (under the current P(z)) and updating P(z) (under the current G), and hopefully this process might converge to a better solution. But I feel this sounds like a new angle and not the one that is adopted by the authors in this paper.\n\n2. I think the discussions around Eq. (1) are not well grounded. Just as you said right before presenting Eq. (1), typically the goal of learning a DGM is just to match Q_x with the true data distrubution P_x. It is **not** however to match Q(x,z) with P(x,z). And btw, don't you need to put E_z[ ... ] around the 2nd term on the r.h.s. ?\n\n3. I find the paper mingles notions from GAN and VAE sometimes and misrepresents some of the key differences between the two.\n\nE.g. in the beginning of the 2nd paragraph in Introduction, the authors write \"Generative models like GANs, VAEs and others typically define a generative model via a deterministic generative mechanism or generator ...\". While I think the use of a **deterministic** generator is probably one of the unique features of GAN, and that is certainly not the case with VAE, where typically people still need to specify an explicit probabilistic generative model.\n\nAnd for this same reason, I find the multiple references of \"a generative model P(x|z)\" in this paper inaccurate and a bit misleading.\n\n4. I'm not sure whether it makes good sense to apply an SVD decomposition to the \\hat{z} vectors. It seems to me the variances \\nu^2_i shall be directly estimated from \\hat{z} as is. Otherwise, the reference \"ideal\" distribution would be modeling a **rotated** version of the \\hat{z} samples, which imo only introduces unnecessary discrepancies.\n\n5. I don't quite agree with the asserted \"multi-modal structure\" in Figure 2. Let's assume a 2d latent space, where each quadrant represents one MNIST digit (e.g. 1,2,3,4). You may observe a similar structure in this latent space yet still learn a good generator under even a standard 2d Gaussian prior. I guess my point is, a seemingly well-partitioned latent space doesn't bear an obvious correlation with a multi-modal distribution in it.\n\n6. The generator reversal procedure needs to be carried out once for each data point separately, and also when the generator has been updated, which seems to be introducing a potentially significant bottleneck into the training process.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Flexible Prior Distributions for Deep Generative Models","abstract":"We consider the problem of training generative models with deep neural networks as generators, i.e. to map latent codes to data points.

To fix this the paper proposes to learn a second GAN to learn the prior distributions of \"real latent code\" of the first GAN. The first GAN then uses the second GAN as prior to generate the z codes. \n \nQuality/clarity:\n\nThe paper is well written and easy to follow.\n\nOriginality:\n\npros:\n-The paper while simple sheds some light on important problem with the prior distribution used in GAN.\n- the second GAN solution trained on reverse codes from real data is interesting \n- In general the topic is interesting, the solution presented is simple but needs more study\n\ncons:\n\n- It related to adversarial learned inference and BiGAN, in term of learning the mapping  z ->x, x->z and seeking the agreement. \n- The solution presented is not end to end (learning a prior generator on learned models have been done in many previous works on encoder/decoder)\n\nGeneral Review:\n\nMore experimentation with the latent codes will be interesting:\n\n- Have you looked at the decay of the singular values of the latent codes obtained from reversing the generator? Is this data low rank? how does this change depending on the dimensionality of the latent codes? Maybe adding plots to the paper can help.\n\n- the prior agreement score is interesting but assuming gaussian prior also for the learned latent codes from real data is maybe not adequate.  Maybe computing the entropy of the codes using a nearest neighbor estimate of the entropy  can help understanding the entropy difference wrt to the isotropic gaussian prior?\n\n- Have you tried to multiply the isotropic normal noise with the learned singular values and generate images from  this new prior  and compute inceptions scores etc? Maybe also rotating the codes with the singular vector matrix V or \\Sigma^{0.5} V?\n\n- What architecture did you use for the prior generator GAN?\n\n- Have you thought of an end to end way to learn the prior generator GAN? \n\n\n\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Flexible Prior Distributions for Deep Generative Models","abstract":"We consider the problem of training generative models with deep neural networks as generators, i.e. to map latent codes to data points.
