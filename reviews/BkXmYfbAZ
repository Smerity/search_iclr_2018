In this setting, through soft ordering, the same layers are effectively applied at different resolutions or scales. Extending Eq.

So far, based on this suggestion, we have tested the idea of adding an identity layer in the CelebA domain. Including the identity layer does improve performance somewhat, and the identity layer sees increased usage in most contexts. The identity layer creates more consistency across contexts, which can make it easier for soft ordering layers to handle each context effectively.

In one such experiment, the set of modules to be used in the soft ordering framework is designed automatically. The modules can be heterogeneous and consist of multiple layers. Interestingly, in the final set of optimized modules, one module is always a single convolutional layer with no nonlinearity, suggesting that including such pass-through structure, similar to including the identity layer, is important to scaling performance.

Thus enabling the reuse of universally learned representations and reuse them by assembling them in novel ways for new unseen tasks. The idea of “soft ordering” enforces the idea that there shall not be a rigid structure for all the tasks, but a soft structure would make the models more generalizable and modular. \n\nThe methods reviewed prior work which the authors refer to as “parallel order”, which assumed that subsequences of the feature hierarchy align across tasks and sharing between tasks occurs only at aligned depths whereas in this work the authors argue that this shouldn’t be the case. They authors then extend the approach to “permuted order” and finally present their proposed “soft ordering” approach. The authors argue that their proposed soft ordering approach increase the expressivity of the model while preserving the performance. \n\nThe “soft ordering” approach simply enable task specific selection of layers, scaled with a learned scaling factor, to be combined in which order to result for the best performance for each task. The authors evaluate their approach on MNIST, UCI, Omniglot and CelebA datasets and compare their approach to “parallel ordering” and “permuted ordering” and show the performance gain.\n\nPositives: \n- The paper is clearly written and easy to follow\n- The idea is novel and impactful if its evaluated properly and consistently \n- The authors did a great job summarizing prior work and motivating their approach\n\nNegatives: \n- Multi-class classification problem is one incarnation of Multi-Task Learning, there are other problems where the tasks are different (classification and localization) or auxiliary (depth detection for navigation).

The good aspect of this paper is that it has some performance improvements. But I still wonder the effect of permuting the layers. The paper also needs more clarifications in the writing. For example, in Section 3.3, how each s_(i, j, k) is sampled from S? The \"parallel ordering\" terminology also seems to be arbitrary...\n\n[1] Lee, Honglak, Chaitanya Ekanadham, and Andrew Y.
