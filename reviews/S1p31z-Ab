If I'm to concat x_k(1x512) with ELMo_k(1x512) to be used as new input, does it mean that I have to modify my model to take 1X1024 sized input?\n\nAnd I haven't clearly understood about appeding ELMo_k on the output side of the task model.\n1. By task model do you mean the biLM?\n2. Or the model that actually gets the task done? (in my case NMT)\nIn either case, could you elaborate more on \"including ELMo at the output of task RNN\"?\n\nThank you for the great paper."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Deep contextualized word representations","abstract":"We introduce a new type of deep contextualized word representation that models both (1) complex characteristics of word use (e.g., syntax and semantics), and (2) how these uses vary across linguistic contexts (i.e., to model polysemy).

What is the performance of the (non deep) baseline method with comparable number of parameters (bigger hidden size)?\n\nMore generally, it is not surprising that given sufficient training data, a deeper model (e.g., ELMO enhanced models) with multiple connections across layers will perform better than shallower models with fewer parameters.\nI would like to see more analysis and/or explanations on why the proposed method contributes more beyond this.","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Deep contextualized word representations","abstract":"We introduce a new type of deep contextualized word representation that models both (1) complex characteristics of word use (e.g., syntax and semantics), and (2) how these uses vary across linguistic contexts (i.e., to model polysemy).

This model is simply a bi-directional language model (biLM) and the word embedding is a weighted combination of the output of the hidden layers (forward and backward). Furthermore like previous work, the authors proposed to pre-train the biLM with a large amount of data and then use the embeddings in combination with the context-independent word embedding in neural network models (in this paper, RNN) for final applications. Their results showed consistent improvements over the baseline and the previous best systems on several tasks.\n\nSome detailed comments:\n-\tI would like to see an overview figure which illustrates the biLM and its integration in downstream applications. Furthermore, it is also interesting to see the performance difference between with and without fine-tuning of the biLM.\n-\tIntrinsic evaluations are missing in this paper. Although we know that word similarity tasks are not the best way to evaluate word embeddings, it is always informative to report results on these standard tasks.\n-\tThe baseline results in table 1 and table 2 are not consistent. Is there something wrong?\n-\tDid the baseline systems use pretrained embeddings or randomly initialized ones? In my opinion, the right baseline systems should use pretrained word2vec or glove embeddings.\n","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Deep contextualized word representations","abstract":"We introduce a new type of deep contextualized word representation that models both (1) complex characteristics of word use (e.g., syntax and semantics), and (2) how these uses vary across linguistic contexts (i.e., to model polysemy).
