One consists in self-labeling the unlabeled data and then updating the prototypes on the basis of the \nassigned pseudo-labels. Another is able to deal with the case of distractors i.e.  unlabeled samples not beloning to\nany of the known categories. In practice this second solution is analogous to the first, but a general 'distractor' class\nis added. Finally the third technique learns to weight the samples according to their distance to the original prototypes.\n\nThese strategies are evaluated in a particular semi-supervised transfer learning setting:  the models are first trained \non some source categories with few labeled data and large unlabeled samples (this setting is derived by subselecting\nmultiple times a large dataset), then they are used on a final target task with again few labeled data and large \nunlabeled samples but beloning to a different set of categories.\n\n+ the paper is well written, well organized and overall easy to read\n+/-  this work builds largely on previous work. It introduces only some small technical novelty inspired by soft-k-means\nclustering that anyway seems to be effective.\n+ different aspect of the problem are analyzed by varying the number of disctractors and varying the level of\nsemantic relatedness between the source and the target sets\n\nFew notes and questions\n1) why for the omniglot experiment the table reports the error results? It would be better to present accuracy as for the other tables/experiments\n2) I would suggest to use source and target instead of train and test -- these two last terms are confusing because\nactually there is a training phase also at test time.\n3) although the paper indicate that there are different other few-shot methods that could be applicable here, \nno other approach is considered besides the prothotipical network and its variants. An further external reference \ncould be used to give an idea of what would be the experimental result at least in the supervised case.\n\n\n\n\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Meta-Learning for Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Classification","abstract":"In few-shot classification, we are interested in learning algorithms that train a\nclassifier from only a handful of labeled examples.

The classical few-shot learning has been limited to using the unlabeled data, while this paper considers employing the unlabeled examples available to help train each episode. The paper solves a new semi-supervised situation, which is more close to the setting of the real world, with an extension of the prototype network.  Sufficient implementation detail and analysis on results.\n\nHowever, this is definitely not the first work on semi-supervised formed few-shot learning. There are plenty of works on this topic [R1, R2, R3]. The authors are advised to do a thorough survey of the relevant works in Multimedia and computer vision community. \n \nAnother concern is that the novelty. This work is highly incremental since it is an extension of existing prototypical networks by adding the way of leveraging the unlabeled data. \n\nThe experiments are also not enough. Not only some other works such as [R1, R2, R3]; but also the other naïve baselines should also be compared, such as directly nearest neighbor classifier, logistic regression, and neural network in traditional supervised learning. Additionally, in the 5-shot non-distractor setting on tiered ImageNet, only the soft kmeans method gets a little bit advantage against the semi-supervised baseline, does it mean that these methods are not always powerful under different dataset?\n\n[R1] “Videostory: A new multimedia embedding for few-example recognition and translation of events,” in ACM MM, 2014\n\n[R2] “Transductive Multi-View Zero-Shot Learning”, IEEE TPAMI 2015\n\n[R3] “Video2vec embeddings recognize events when examples are scarce,” IEEE TPAMI 2014\n","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Meta-Learning for Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Classification","abstract":"In few-shot classification, we are interested in learning algorithms that train a\nclassifier from only a handful of labeled examples.
