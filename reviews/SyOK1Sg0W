We have modified the paper accordingly and highlighted the changes in blue. We have also resolved the missing references and typos. Below, we discuss the points mentioned by the reviewer in detail.\n\nQuestion: From the tables and figures, it is difficult to grasp the decrease in accuracy when using the quantized model, compared to the full precision model, and also the relative memory compression. It would be nice to have this reference in the plots of figure 3.   \n\nAnswer: Thanks for pointing this out. In the revised version, we highlight the optimal trade-off between accuracy and model size for each model in Figure 3. We further report the accuracy and the reduction in the model size for these optimal models. We observe compression ratios of these optimal models equal to 64x, 35x, and 13x (corresponding to 98.4%, 97%, and 92% reductions in model size) for MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN, with 0.12%, -0.02%, and 0.7% decrease in accuracy, respectively. We modified section 4 to clarify these results. \n\n \n\nQuestion: Also, it is difficult to see the benefits in terms of memory/accuracy compromise since not all competing quantization techniques are compared for all the datasets.  \n\nAnswer: In Figure 3, we have added comparisons with the BinaryConnect technique for all three datasets. This technique can often improve the accuracy of BNN with the same model size. Yet, these comparisons confirm our original results. That is, the proposed method almost always outperforms state-of-the-art of quantization (BinaryConnect and BNN) and consistently produces competitive results.

It would be interesting to know an analogy, for instance, saying that this adaptive compression in memory would be equivalent to quantizing all weights with n bits.  \n\nAnswer: Figures 2 (a, b, c), for clarity, only show non-pruned parameters, which comprise a small portion of the original parameters of the model. Taking these parameters into account, adaptive quantization compresses MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN models to equivalent of 0.03, 0.27, and 1.3 bits per parameter, respectively (results are for the optimal trade-off points highlighted in Figure 3). These are all significantly smaller or  comparable to state-of-the-art of quantization, that is, BNN and BinaryConnect (1 bit per parameter). We have modified section 4 with these clarifications and updated Figure 2 (a, b, c) to include the pruned parameters for comparison with non-pruned parameters. \n\n \n\nQuestion: missing references in several points of the paper.

How would this scale to larger datasets?  \n\nAnswer: Gradients are calculated on minibatches. As we have specified in section 3, we use the same batch size for training and quantization to keep the computation time short. Our experiments show that this decision does not have a negative effect on the accuracy of the quantized model. Thus, as long as we choose representative batch sizes, as we do for training, the algorithm scales to larger datasets with no need for modifications.

In general, we can expect the quantization depth to be smaller than this value. That is because Algorithm 1 minimizes the bit width of a parameter with respect to its tolerance. If multiple bit widths satisfy this requirement, the smallest is always chosen. For example, a parameter with the signed value equal to 0.25 can be represented by both 001 and 0010.

We have modified the manuscript based on the questions from the reviewer. The changes and additions to the paper have been highlighted in blue. Below we discuss each of the questions in more detail one-by-one.\n\nQuestion: I have a number of questions and concerns about the proposed approach. First, at a high level, there are many details that aren't clear from the text. Quantization has some bookkeeping associated with it: In a per-parameter quantization setup it will be necessary to store not just the quantized parameter, but also the number of bits used in the quantization (takes e.g. 4-5 extra bits), and there will be some metadata necessary to encode how the quantized value should be converted back to floating point (e.g., for 8-bit quantization of a layer of weights, usually the min and max are stored). From Algorithm 1 it appears the quantization assumes parameters in the range [0, 1]. Don't negative values require another bit? What happens to values larger than 1? How are even bit depths and associated asymmetries w.r.t. 0 handled (e.g., three bits can represent -1, 0, and 1, but 4 must choose to either not represent 0 or drop e.g. -1)? None of these details are clearly discussed in the paper, and it's not at all clear that the estimates of compression are correct if these bookkeeping matters aren't taken into account properly. \n\nAnswer: We agree with the reviewer that it is important to evaluate the potential overhead of bookkeeping. However, we should also have in mind that bookkeeping has an intricate relationship with the target hardware, which may lead to radically different results on different hardware platforms (ranging from 0 to ~60%). For example, our experiments show that on specialized hardware, such as the one designed by Albericio et al (2017) for processing variable bit width CNN, we can fully offset all bookkeeping overheads of storing quantization depths, while CPU/GPU may require up to 60% additional storage. We will study this complex relationship separately, in our future work, and in the context of hardware implementation. In this paper, we limit the scope to algorithm analysis, independent of underlying hardware architectures. We note that in this analysis, we have evaluated the metadata as well as the additional sign bits. The metadata overhead is negligible (about 4 bytes per layer) due to the balanced quantization of algorithm 1 which divides the range [0,1] into equally sized partitions and assigns a single bit to each parameter. As we discuss in the answer to the next question, this scheme eliminates the need to convert parameters back to floating-point, and computations can be performed directly on the quantized values. For example, the 5-bit signed value 01011, for example, represents 2^(-1)+2^(-3)+2^(-4)=0.6875 (the initial 0 bit represents a positive value), which can be easily multiplied with other values using fixed-point shifts and additions. If it is necessary to have parameters in a larger range, say [-S, S], a scale value like S (4 bytes of metadata) could be allocated for each layer, that is applied to the output of that layer. We have clarified these points in the updated version of the paper, in section 2 and section 3. \n\nAlbericio, Jorge, et al. \"Bit-pragmatic deep neural network computing.\" Proceedings of the 50th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture. ACM, 2017. \n\n \n\nQuestion: Additionally the paper implies that this style of quantization has benefits for compute in addition to memory savings. This is highly dubious, since the method will require converting all parameters to a standard bit-depth on the fly (probably back to floating point, since some parameters may have been quantized with bit depth up to 32). Alternatively custom GEMM/conv routines would be required which are impossible to make efficient for weights with varying bit depths. So there are likely not runtime compute or memory savings from such an approach.  \n\nAnswer: We agree that on CPU/GPU interpreting variable-bit width parameters may incur computational costs. However, our quantization scheme significantly reduces the necessary computation on our target platforms, that is, specialized hardware like Alberricio et al (2017) or configurable hardware like FPGAs. These platforms can directly process the variable-bit width, fixed-point parameters without the need to convert them into floating point, and can implement custom computation units to efficiently perform matrix multiplication/convolutions by taking advantage of the small quantization depths of the parameters in the quantized model. We note that in our experiments, parameters are often quantized with far fewer bits than 32, with little to no accuracy loss. Thus, our approach can significantly accelerate performance on this class of hardware by minimizing the required computations.

The problem and the proposed solution is well motivated. However, there are some elements of the manuscript that are hard to follow and need further clarification/information. These need to definitely be addressed before this paper can be accepted.\n\nSpecific comments/questions:\n- Page 1: Towards the bottom, in the 3rd to last line, reference is missing.\n- Page 1: It is a little hard to follow the motivation against existing methods.\n- Page 2: DenseNets and DeepCompression need citations\n- Lemma 2.1 seems interesting - is this original work? This needs to be clarified.\n- Lemma 2.2: Reference to Equation 17 (which has not been presented in the manuscript at this point) seems a little confusing and I am unable to following the reasoning and the subsequent proof which again refers to Equation 17.\n- Alg 2: Should it be $\\Delta$ or $\\Delta_{k+1}$? Because in one if branch, we use $\\Delta$, in the other, we use the subscripted one.\n- Derivation in section 2.3 has some typographical errors.\n- What is $d$ in Equation 20 (with cases)? Without this information, it is unclear how the singular points are handled.\n- Page 6, first paragraph of Section 3: The evaluation is a little confusing - when is the compression being applied during the training process, and how is the training continued post-compression? What does each compression 'pass' constitute of?\n- Figure 1b: what is the 'iteration' on the horizontal axis, is it the number of iterations of Alg3 or Alg2? Hoping it is Alg3 but needs to be clarified in the text.\n- Section 3: What about compression results for CIFAR and SVNH?
