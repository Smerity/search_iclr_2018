We have revised the paper, added further experiments and addressed your comments.\n\n1. We introduced a novel sampling operator for upsampling and downsampling based on Qslim framework[1] in Section 3. This achieves better performance for sampling 3D meshes while preserving their structure (Figure 1 in the revised paper). We get better reconstructions and lower errors using this sampling technique. The earlier version of our paper used [2] for sampling which was a more general approach for graphs. This resulted in irregular surfaces with high frequency noise.\n\n2. We added comparisons of our results with [3], a recently published state of art model for representing 3D faces (Table 5). We achieve better reconstruction errors than [3].\n\n3. We added further experiments to evaluate the performance of [3] when parts of it are replaced by our trained mesh autoencoder (Table 6). We show that using replacing expression model of [3] with mesh autoencoder improves its performance.\n\n4. Minor corrections are incorporated as suggested in the new version.\n\nWe address comments specific to the reviewers in the sections below.\n\n[1] Michael Garland and Paul S Heckbert.

The underlying technique that is used to operate on the irregular graph is spectral decomposition, which enables convolutions in the spectral domain. \n\nThe spectral convolution methods have been applied to mesh data structures for about 5 years now, as stated in the paper as well [Bruna et al. 2013], [Defferrard et al. 2016], [Bronstein et al. 2017], [Li et al. 2017] ... The paper states that it builds upon the formulation in [Defferrard et al. 2016] as explained in section 3. \n\nGiven the facts above, I am having a hard time to understand the novelty of this paper? Is it the \"Mesh Upsampling\" operation defined at the end of page 4? If that is the case, it is not demonstrated in the paper that it actually works. The main reason is that the original face mesh graph that goes into the convolution/downsampling\n operations is topologically preserved through the upconvolutions. This means that the upsampling operation is not really upsampling a \"true\" graph/mesh. The topology is already known, the upsampling just predicts a function on this topology. \n\n The choice of the face domain is also suspicious, since all faces are topologically the same graph (even though there are geometric variations). Convolutions/downsampling-convolutions/upsampling that are demonstrated in the paper basically boil down to function prediction on the same exact global graph. Face topologies are so regular that they can even be represented with a height map like geometry encoding in the image plane (See [1'] below). \n\n To demonstrate the \"mesh/graph generation\" capability truly, the authors need to experiment on novel topology generation. As is, the paper does not bear enough novelty on top of [Defferrard et al. 2016], or is not demonstrating it even if there exists any.\n\n[1'] Z. Shu, E. Yumer, S. Hadap, K. Sunkavalli, E.

The novelty here how the problem is formulated.\n\nPros:\n- Interesting formulation. I have not seen this particular setup for processing meshes with neural networks in an autoencoder setting. \n- This work collected a new dataset for 3D face expression representation, which is great (the state of 3D face databases which are available to researchers is very limited, so this is a step in the right direction).\n\nCons:\n- The visual depiction of the auto-encoded meshes looks a bit strange. In particular, they exhibit some high frequency artefacts. These do not appear in the smoother PCA version. From a human standpoint, in those cases, the smoother meshes would in fact be preferable. I did not see a discussion about this, given that such problems are not captured by the metrics.\n- I am a bit confused by the requirement that all meshes need to have the same adjacency matrix. Does this mean that you need to convert the raw meshes coming from the 3D camera into a particular topology before you can use this algorithm? If yes, this seems like a rather large limitation.\n- Regarding the evaluation, you wrote:\"In order to evaluate the interpolation capability of the autoencoder, we split the dataset in training and test samples in the ratio of 1:9. The test samples are obtained by picking consecutive frames of\nlength 10 uniformly at random across the sequences. \" - To me this is very unclear. You have very few sequeces/subjects. Did  you split by *subject*? I think this is CRUCIAL, and a lot of the results hinge on this answer.\n\nGeneral Questions\n\nI am  wondering how come you didn't consider a geometry image representation of the meshes, and went for a slightly more general, and yet very confined alternative (the adjacency requirement, which in some sense is the same type of constraint as geometry images). On geometry images, in particular it would be possible to apply standard convolutional architectures without any special processing.\n\nAnother question that I had is why use a L1 loss when in the evaluation you're using L2? It would make a lot of sense to use the same loss as the evaluation metric (not to mention the properties of PCA).","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Convolutional Mesh Autoencoders for 3D Face Representation","abstract":"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state of the art performance on recognizing and representing audio, images, videos and 3D volumes; that is, domains where the input can be characterized by a regular graph structure. \nHowever, generalizing CNNs to irregular domains like 3D meshes is challenging.
