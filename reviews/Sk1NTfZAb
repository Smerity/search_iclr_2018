More specifically, a training participant can construct a generative adversarial network (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) such that its GAN model learns to reconstruct training examples of one of the other participants over the training iterations. \n\nThis is given as the motivation for this work, but this statement is very flawed. Hitaj et al. do not \"break\" differential privacy. The problem is that they use differential privacy with extremely large parameter values, which yields a meaningless privacy guarantee.\n\nFrank McSherry has posted a detailed critique of the Hitaj et al. paper here:\n\nhttps://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2017-10-27.md"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Key Protected Classification for GAN Attack Resilient Collaborative Learning","abstract":"Large-scale publicly available datasets accelerate deep learning studies.

However collaborative learning has been shown to be suscepti\nble to active attacks in which one of the participants uses a GAN to reveal information about another participant.\n\nThis paper proposes a collaborative learning framework (CLF) that mitigates the GAN attack. The framework involves using the neural net to learn a mapping of the inp\nut to a high-dimensional vector and computing the inner product of this vector to a random class-specific key (the final class prediction is the argmax of this inner product). The class-specific key can be chosen randomly by each participant. By choosing sufficiently long random keys, the probability of an attacker guessing the key can be reduced. Experiments on two datasets show that this scheme successfully avoids the GAN attack.\n \n1. Some of the details of key sharing are not clear and would appear to be important for the scheme to work. For example, if participants have instances associated with the same class, then they would need to share the key. This would require a central key distribution scheme which would then allow the attacker to also get access to the key.\n\n2. I would have  liked to see how the method works with an increasing fraction of adversarial participants (I could only see experiments with one adversary). Similarly, I would have liked to see experiments with and without the fixed dense layer to see its contribution to effective learning.

In order to avoid the potential risk of adversary's mimic based on information flow among distributed users, the authors propose to embed the class label into a multi-dimensional space, such that the joint learning is conducted over the embedding space without knowing the accurate representation of the classes. Under the assumption that the adversary can only generate fake and random class representations, they show their scheme is capable of hiding information from individual samples, especially over image data.\n\nThe paper is clearly written and easy to understand. The experiments show interesting results, which are particularly impressive with the face data. However, the reviewer feels the assumption on the adversary is generally too weak, such that slightly smarter adversary could circumvent the protection scheme and remain effective on sample recovery.\n\nBasically, instead of randomly guessing the representations of the classes from other innocent users, the adversary could apply GAN to learn the representation based on the feedback from these users. This can be easily done by including the representations in the embedding space in the parameters in GAN for learning.\n\nThis paper could be an interesting work, if the authors address such enhanced attacks from the adversary and present protection results over their existing experimental settings.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Key Protected Classification for GAN Attack Resilient Collaborative Learning","abstract":"Large-scale publicly available datasets accelerate deep learning studies.
