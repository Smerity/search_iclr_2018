For a large enough C_2 we indeed have a lower bound on the margin \\gamma> A where A<0. However the bound on the GE then becomes vacuous as by definition gamma > 0.  For consistency we have added the constraint that the base in the exponentiation needs to be positive, and thus the C_2 should be sufficiently small. Furthermore we have made a direct computation of the ratio between two GE bounds in section 4.3 which shows that the error C_2 is indeed small enough at least for the LeNet-5 architecture.\n\nConcerning the generality of our approach please note that our method can be applied with any convex regulariser, possibly with ones that do not aim at network compression, but for example for protection against adversarial examples. Also our theoretical analysis of the GE includes not only pruning but any type of bounded perturbation to one or multiple hidden layers.\n\nWe have also added a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of our algorithm.

It's usage was meant to convey that the minimisation of the linearised objective in the DCA iterations, is done using stochastic gradient descent. \n\n- The theoretical analysis of the generalisation error was based largely on Theorem 2 and Corollary 1 page 8 in [1] as well as Theorem 3 page 6 of [2]. It is in this last theorem that the assumption for the 0-1 loss is needed, the loss needs to be non-negative and upper bounded by a scalar M. We will restate all the relevant theorems in the Appendix for clarity, and provide some discussion on the proposed generalisation bound.\n\n-One cause for the non-trivial loss of accuracy is that we use Proximal Stochastic Gradient Descent for the optimisation. Prox-SGD fails to converge to a good solution within the given iterations. We propose to instead use Proximal Stochastic Variance Reduction (Prox-SVRG). This has so far improved our results. We are currently conducting more experiments to address this and other reviewer questions and to further validate our claims.\n\n-Please note that the GE bound depends on constants that are difficult to calculate for real data, such as the intrinsic data dimensionality \"k\". This in turn makes plotting the theoretical GE bound non-trivial. However the bound should give a good intuition about the behaviour of a DNN in relation to the margin \"gamma\" as the underlying assumptions that it makes have been tested empirically in [1] [3].\n\n[1] Sokolic, Jure, et al. \"Robust large margin deep neural networks.\" IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing (2017).\n[2] Xu, Huan, and Shie Mannor. \"Robustness and generalization.\" Machine learning 86.3 (2012): 391-423.\n[3] Sokolic, Jure, et al. \"Generalization Error of Invariant Classifiers.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.04574 (2016)."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Cheap DNN Pruning with Performance Guarantees ","abstract":"Recent DNN pruning algorithms have succeeded in reducing the number of parameters in fully connected layers often with little or no drop in classification accuracy.

The proposed algorithm is an improvement of Net-Trim (Aghasi et al., 2016), which is to enforce the weights to be sparse.\n\nThe main contribution of this manuscript is that the non-convex optimization problem in (Aghasi et al., 2016) is reformulated as a difference of convex (DC) problem, which can be solved quite efficiently using the DCA algorithm (Tao and An, 1997). The complexity of the proposed algorithm is much lower than Net-Trim and its fast version LOBS (Dong et al., 2017). The authors also analyze the generalization error bound of DNN after pruning based on the work of (Sokolic et al., 2017).\n\nAlthough this is an incremental work built upon (Aghasi et al., 2016) and an existing algorithm (Tao and An, 1997) is adopted for optimization, the contribution is valuable since the complexity is significantly reduced by utilizing the proposed difference of convex reformulation. Although the main idea is clearly presented, there are many syntax errors and I suggest the authors carefully checking the manuscript.\n\nPros:\n1.\tThe motivation is clear and the presented reformulation is reasonable.\n\n2.\tThe generalization error analysis and the conclusion of “layers closer to the input are exponentially less robust to pruning” is interesting.\n\nCons:\n1.\tThere are many syntax errors, e.g., “Closer to our approach recently in Aghasi et al.
