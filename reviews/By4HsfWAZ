In particular, they use a CNN encoder-decoder to learn a motion field, and a warping function from the last component to provide forecasting. \n\nI like the idea of using deep learning for physical equations. I would like to see a description of the algorithm with the pseudo-code in order to understand the flow of the method. I got confused at several points because it was not clear what was exactly being estimated with the CNN. Having an algorithmic environment would make the description easier. I know that authors are going to publish the code, but this is not enough at this point of the revision. \n\nPhysical processes in Machine learning have been studied from the perspective of Gaussian processes. Just to mention a couple of references “Linear latent force models using Gaussian processes” and \"Numerical Gaussian Processes for Time-dependent and Non-linear Partial Differential Equations\"\n\nIn Theorem 2, do you need to care about boundary conditions for your equation? I didn’t see any mention to those in the definition for I(x,t). You only mention initial conditions. How do you estimate the diffusion parameter D? Are you assuming isotropic diffusion? Is that realistic? Can you provide more details about how you run the data assimilation model in the experiments? Did you use your own code?\n","confidence":"2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Deep Learning for Physical Processes: Incorporating Prior Scientific Knowledge","abstract":"We consider  the use of Deep Learning methods for modeling complex phenomena like those occurring in natural physical processes.

They notably show\nhow physical priors on a given phenomenon can be incorporated in the learning process and propose \nan application on the problem of estimating sea surface temperature directly from a given \ncollection of satellite images.\n\nAll in all the paper is very clear and interesting. The results obtained on the considered problem\nare clearly of great interest, especially when compared to state-of-the-art assimilation strategies\nsuch as the one of Béréziat. While the learning architecture is not original in itself, it is \nshown that a proper physical regularization greatly improves the performance. For these reasons I \nbelieve the paper has sufficient merits to be published at ICLR. That being said, I believe that \nsome discussions could strengthen the paper:\n - Most classical variational assimilation schemes are stochastic in nature, notably by incorporating\nuncertainties in the observation or physical evolution models. It is still unclear how those uncertainties \ncan be integrated in the model;\n - Assimilation methods are usually independent of the type of data at hand. It is not clear how the model\nlearnt on one particular type of data transpose to other data sequences. Notably, the question of transfer\nand generalization is of high relevance here. Does the learnt model performs well on other dataset (for instance,\nacquired on a different region or at a distant time). I believe this type of issue has to be examinated \nfor this type of approach to be widely use in inverse physical problems. \n","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Deep Learning for Physical Processes: Incorporating Prior Scientific Knowledge","abstract":"We consider  the use of Deep Learning methods for modeling complex phenomena like those occurring in natural physical processes.
