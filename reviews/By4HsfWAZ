Incorporating uncertainty in the model\nThis is the next step of our work. We could introduce uncertainties in different forms. We started to work on a variant of this model using a scheme similar to conditional VAE (Variational Auto Encoder) with the idea that the model should be able to predict multiple potential vector flow candidates instead of a mean value. VAEs allow sampling from noise distributions and then generating diverse candidates. We have added a paragraph in the “Conclusion and future work” section where we discuss this point and provide some references indicating what type of approach could be used.\n\n\n2. Generalization to other instances\n\n\nWe agree that the potential of the model should also be evaluated for other conditions and at other places. This is however a whole study by itself involving dealing with different datasets, and performing many different types of tests. For now we do not have the availability of such datasets and this is left for further study.\nIn order to provide some indications on the generalization performance, we however performed some additional tests on the available data. We evaluated the model on data distant in time and in space. For the former, we trained the model on the period 2011-2017 and tested on 2006-2010. The regions are the same as the one used in the main text (regions numbered 17 to 20 on figure 4). We have plotted the daily MSE on Figure 6 appendix B in the new version of the paper. The conclusion is that the range of error remains the same and there is a slight tendency for the error to increase when the time distance between test and train increases too. \n For the latter (sequences from different regions), we have trained the model on 2 regions and tested on 2 other regions (and permuted the couples of regions). The two couples of regions have different dynamics. Results are provided on table 2, appendix B. The conclusion here is again that the range of error values remains the same. The error depends more on the region dynamics than on the train / test conditions. For regions with high dynamics, the loss is higher than for stable regions. Performance degrades more for the former regions than for the latter when the training set is sampled from a different region. Extensive additional tests should be performed in order to go beyond these partial conclusions.\n\nNote also that it is possible to fine-tune the model using available data of the specific zone in question. Other work, such as [Fischer and al], or [Ilg and al], suggest that deep models trained to predict a motion vector field can generalize from synthetic to real data, and when fine-tuned, there is an improvement in performance.\n\n[Fischer and al]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06852\n[Ilg and al]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01925\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Deep Learning for Physical Processes: Incorporating Prior Scientific Knowledge","abstract":"We consider  the use of Deep Learning methods for modeling complex phenomena like those occurring in natural physical processes.

As you mentioned, the model is composed of two components: a CDNN which acts as a motion estimator, and a warping mechanism which predicts the future observation by moving the present observation along the motion field. The output of the CDNN is a vector field, i.e. a tensor of size WxHx2 where W and H are the width and height of the input images, and ‘2’ corresponds to the velocity.\n\nInference and training work as follows:\n\nInference - Input:  an image sequence (I_t-k+1,...,I_t) of k consecutive images representing temperature acquisitions. Output: an image sequence ( \\hat{I}_t+1, \\hat{I}_t+K) of K consecutive image predictions. Given the inputs (I_t-k+1,...,I_t) the CDNN will compute an estimated vector field \\hat{w}_t. This vector field is then used to advect image I_t so as to compute an estimate of the future observation I_t+1. For multiple time step prediction (i.e. K > 1), the computed output \\hat{I}_t+1 is fed back into the CDNN, leading to the following input sequence (I_t-k+2, …, I_t, \\hat{I}_t+1) for estimating motion w_t+1. One can then estimate I_t+2 by advecting image \\hat{I}_t+1 using \\hat{w}_t+1, and so on.\n\nTraining - The training set is a consecutive sequence of images.  An example is sampled from the training set and a loss value is computed between the model prediction and the target. Since the warping scheme (the solution to the advection-diffusion equation) is entirely differentiable, the gradient of the loss can be backpropagated through this component for modifying the parameters the CDNN module. \n\nBelow is a pseudo-code for the training step\n\nInput: training set : sequence of SST images I_{1:T}\nOutput: trained model parameters (CDNN parameters)\nIterate until convergence\n--  Sample a sequence I_{t- k+1 : t+K} of images\n\n-- Forward pass of the model: using I_{t-k+1 : t }, we infer K future observations I_{t+1 : t+K} using the inference scheme proposed above.\n\n-- Compute the loss between the targets and model predictions.\n\n-- Backward pass of the model.  The gradient of the loss function with respect to the CDNN parameters is back propagated through the warping scheme in order to update the CDNN parameters via SGD (in the experiments we used Adam).\n\n2. Thanks for the references on Gaussian processes. We did not go through the GP literature on the topic of physico-statistical modeling. Even if the methods and the application are different, the motivation and arguments are clearly similar.  We have added the references you suggested in the new version of the paper plus additional references in the related work section, under ‘ML for Physical modeling’.\n\n3. In the theorem, a sufficient condition for the existence of this solution of the advection-diffusion equation, is that the image function I is square-integrable, (the square of I is Lebesgue integrable). A consequence is that I tends to zero as x approaches infinity. This will allow us to calculate the solution. In practice, we do consider that I has a compact support, i.e. I is zero outside its definition domain \\Omega. This latter case is more specific than the square integrable hypothesis, and the theorem still applies. We have added a more detailed proof of the theorem in the appendix.\n\n4. We did make the hypothesis that diffusion is isotropic and this is one of the simplification hypotheses adopted in the paper. Our intention was to give a proof of concept about the incorporation of prior knowledge, and to show that the proposed approach performed on par with more complex state of the art assimilation methods. If we focused on the application itself, improvements could probably be brought by including additional priors. In particular, attention mechanisms could be added to the warping mechanism for modeling anisotropy.\n\n5. The diffusion parameter D is estimated on a validation set and its value is 0.45 - this is now indicated in the paper.\n \n6. The data assimilation code is run  with a specific code provided by the authors of (Bereziat 2015). We had several interactions with the paper authors while performing the tests with their methods.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Deep Learning for Physical Processes: Incorporating Prior Scientific Knowledge","abstract":"We consider  the use of Deep Learning methods for modeling complex phenomena like those occurring in natural physical processes.

In the regularization scheme - equation 6 - you are using the gradient and the divergence. With respect to what quantity (e.g. the input?) are you taking the gradient, and if it is the input, what is exactly is the divergence than when the input is not the cartesian coordinates but numerical values?\n\n2. Could you elaborate in more detail of how \"exactly\" did you use NEMO in order to obtain the data used for training? My understanding is that you used the NOAA6 data and assimilate it into the NEMO engine. However, there are a few core engines under the NEMO project. I know this might be frustrating but for reproducibility, this would be very helpful as I don't think many people are familiar with the software. Or of how to actually to obtain the data from NOAA6.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Deep Learning for Physical Processes: Incorporating Prior Scientific Knowledge","abstract":"We consider  the use of Deep Learning methods for modeling complex phenomena like those occurring in natural physical processes.

Since the integration is on R^2, we introduce the two corresponding 1-D variables, we then separate the Fourier transform of the advection term into two terms corresponding to each variable. Using an integration by parts for both terms and re-integrating with respect to the other variable, we obtain the solution. We will provide the details in a updated version.\n2. The parameter k was chosen by testing on the validation set. The optimal tradeoff between complexity and accuracy appears to be k=4.\n3. If the value of the pixel comes from outside the frame, we use the mean value of the pixels of the image. Since this is not informative, the model thus learns not to use values coming from outside the frame. \n4.
