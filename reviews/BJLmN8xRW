In the revised version of the paper, we have also added results for a multilayer perceptron with 1 hidden layer that is trained on the same expert defined features as the random forest. These features are extracted from the domain names in a preprocessing step, i.e. each domain name is converted into a list of features (numerical values). The drawback of this is that it makes machine learning models for DGA detection vulnerable to being outdated, when hackers learn about the expert defined features and come up with new DGA algorithms to circumvent them. A recent, successful approach in machine learning for DGA detection is therefore to not extract any features at all a-priori and instead give the entire domain name string as a raw input signal to a deep network that learns by itself which features to extract. The features extracted by a deep network are in no way predefined by a human, and it is even famously difficult to interpret them. Furthermore, such deep networks can even outperform systems that incorporate human knowledge, as is clear from our experiments: all deep networks significantly outperform the random forest as well as a multilayer perceptron trained with human defined features. Note that there is no straightforward way at all to train a random forest directly on a raw domain name string. The ability to learn what features to extract from raw input is a defining characteristic of deep learning.\n \nFor the results reported in the paper, we split the dataset once into 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing, and kept this exact same split throughout all the experiments. In other words, the numbers reported in the paper result from running each experiment once. They are not averages. We are aware that for small to medium-sized datasets, k-fold cross-validation gives a more reliable estimate of the predictive performance of models. In our initial experiments (not included in the paper), we trained and evaluated some of the deep networks using 5-fold cross-validation. We found that the difference across folds was small, which is a known phenomenon when working with large datasets. Given the high computational cost for training an individual deep network (up to 10 hours), we therefore decided to go forward with a single 80-10-10 split and keep this consistent across all experiments, i.e. each model reported on in the paper is trained on exactly the same set of domain names, and tested on exactly the same set of domain names (fully disjoint from the training dataset). For the revised version of the paper, we have created an additional prospective test dataset with DGAs that were observed in real traffic in December 2017. The additional results included in the paper (Table 4) show how the deep neural networks trained on data from July 2017 hold up against such a prospective dataset with “future” data.\n\nOur results were obtained, as pointed out by reviewer 3, by computationally expensive experiments, carefully designed and implemented. They required computational power that can be prohibitive for many other researchers who are interested in using deep learning models for DGA detection.  As we previously stated, we believe our results are of practical value for people designing such kind of classifiers in industry and academia. In the revised version of the paper, we have extended our comparison of all the studied models regarding computational performance for training and scoring (as suggested by reviewer 3). \n\nFinally, we thank reviewer 3 for raising the presentation issues. We have addressed them in the revised version (including the creation of a separate “Background” section)."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Character Level Based Detection of DGA Domain Names","abstract":"Recently several different deep learning architectures have been proposed that take a string of characters as the raw input signal and automatically derive features for text classification.

Given that, in practice, these models would be continuously re-trained to add new families (online learning), optimizing the training time is an important question.\n\nThe issue raised by reviewer 1 about generating adversarial examples is an important one. In the revised version of the paper, we cited the following recent work, and put it in context:\n\nAnderson, Hyrum S., Jonathan Woodbridge, and Bobby Filar. \"DeepDGA: Adversarially-Tuned Domain Generation and Detection.\" In Proceedings of the 2016 ACM Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Security, pp. 13-21. ACM, 2016.\n\nIn this paper, a character-based generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to augment training sets in order to harden other machine learning models (like a random forest) against yet-to-be-observed DGAs. It is highly unlikely for attackers to use GANs themselves, because DGA algorithms must be light enough to be embedded inside malware code. Furthermore, generating domain names that look like a benign domain is not enough for an effective DGA. Ideally, every domain produced by a DGA must not have been registered yet or must have a low likelihood of being registered already – if a domain produced by a DGA has already been taken, it is useless for the botmaster.  Combining all these requirements is essential for a serious study of adversarial generated domains and requires a paper of itself.\n\nThe controlling factor in our experiments is, in a sense, the accuracy (TPR). The Endgame and Invincea models resulted, after very small adaptations, in a very similar accuracy. We adjusted the other architectures (CMU, NYU, MIT) to achieve a similar performance. This was relatively easy to do, with a good amount of trial and error. For all models, at 97%-98% TPR we hit a plateau through which we have not been able to break yet.  \n\nWe addressed the presentation issues raised by reviewer 1 in the revised version.

A class of malware uses algorithms to automatically generate artificial domain names for various purposes, e.g. to generate large numbers of rendezvous points. DGA detection concerns the (automatic) distinction of actual and artificially generated domain names. In this paper, a basic problem formulation and general solution approach is investigated, namely that of treating the detection as a text classification task and to let domain names arrive to the classifier as strings of characters. A set of five deep learning architectures (both CNNs and RNNs) are compared empirical on the text classification task. A domain name data set with two million instances is used for the experiments. The main conclusion is that the different architectures are almost equally accurate and that this prompts a preference of simpler architectures over more complex architectures, since training time and the likelihood for overfitting can potentially be reduced.\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nThe introduction is well-written, clear, and concise. It describes the studied real-world problem and clarifies the relevance and challenge involved in solving the problem. The introduction provides a clear overview of deep learning architectures that have already been proposed for solving the problem as well as some architectures that could potentially be used. One suggestion for the introduction is that the authors take some of the description of the domain problem and put it into a separate background section to reduce the text the reader has to consume before arriving at the research problem and proposed solution.\n\nThe methods section (Section 2) provides a clear description of each of the five architectures along with brief code listings and details about whether any changes or parameter choices were made for the experiment. In the beginning of the section, it is not clarified why, if a 75 character string is encoded as a 128 byte ASCII sequence, the content has to be stored in a 75 x 128 matrix instead of a vector of size 128. This is clarified later but should perhaps be discussed earlier to allow readers from outside the subarea to grasp the approach.\n\nSection 3 describes the experiment settings, the results, and discusses the learned representations and the possible implications of using either the deep architectures or the “baseline” Random Forest classifier. Perhaps, the authors could elaborate a little bit more on why Random Forests were trained on a completely different set of features than the deep architectures? The data is stated to be randomly divided into training (80%), validation (10%), and testing (10%). How many times is this procedure repeated? (That is, how many experimental runs were averaged or was the experiment run once?).\n\nIn summary, this is an interesting and well-written paper on a timely topic. The main conclusion is intuitive. Perhaps the conclusion is even regarded as obvious by some but, in my opinion, the result is important since it was obtained from new, rather extensive experiments on a large data set and through the comparison of several existing (earlier proposed) architectures. Since the main conclusion is that simple models should be prioritised over complex ones (due to that their accuracy is very similar), it would have been interesting to get some brief comments on a simplicity comparison of the candidates at the conclusion.\n\nMINOR COMMENTS\n\nAbstract: “Little studies” -> “Few studies”\n\nTable 1: “approach” -> “approaches”\n\nFigure 1: Use the same y-axis scale for all subplots (if possible) to simplify comparison.

Training and evaluating on a dataset with 2M domain names shows that there is surprisingly little difference between various convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) based architectures in terms of accuracy, prompting a preference for the simpler architectures, since they are faster to train and less prone to overfitting.","pdf":"/pdf/6ca63b6b9791cfdd252b69964f3096d3f0a273a6.pdf","TL;DR":"A comparison of five deep neural network architectures for detection of malicious domain names shows surprisingly little difference.","paperhash":"anonymous|character_level_based_detection_of_dga_domain_names","_bibtex":"@article{\n  anonymous2018character,\n  title={Character Level Based Detection of DGA Domain Names},\n  author={Anonymous},\n  journal={International Conference on Learning Representations},\n  year={2018},\n  url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJLmN8xRW}\n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper273/Authors"],"keywords":["deep neural networks","short text classification","cybersecurity","domain generation algorithms","malicious domain names"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":7,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"}],"limit":2000,"offset":0}
