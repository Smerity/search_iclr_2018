Such bounds were derived in [1] for the choice $g(a,b)=max{a+b,0}$ corresponding to ReLU activation.  However, since [1] only treats specific mode trees T and index sets I, its bounds cannot be readily used in place of theorem 1.\n\nIn terms of our experiments, we present results for the setting $g(a,b)=max{a+b,0}$ (ReLU) merely due to its popularity in practice.  The exact same trends occur under the choice $g(a.b)=a*b$ (convolutional arithmetic circuits).  We have added a footnote to the paper indicating this.\n\n[1] Cohen and Shashua.

A key technical tool is a mixed tensor decomposition, which is shown to have representational advantage over the individual hierarchical decompositions it comprises.\n\nPros:\n\nExisting work have focused on understanding the depth of the networks and established that deep networks are expressively efficient with respect to shallow ones. On the other hand, this paper focused on the architectural feature of connectivity. The problem is fundamentally important and its theoretical development is solid. The conclusion is useful for developing new tools for deep network design. \n\nCons:\n\nIn order to show that the mixed dilated convolutional network is expressively efficient w.r.t. the corresponding individual dilated convolutional network, the authors prove it in two steps: Proposition 1 and Proposition 2. However, in the proof of Proposition 2 (see Theorem 1), the authors only focus on a particular case of convolutional arithmetic circuits, i.e., $g(a,b)= a*b$. In the experiments, see line 4 of page 9, the authors instead used ReLU activation $g(a, b)= max{a+b, 0}$. Can authors provide some justifications of such different choices of activation functions? It would be great if authors can discuss how to generate the activation function in Theorem 1 to more general cases.\n\n\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Boosting Dilated Convolutional Networks with Mixed Tensor Decompositions","abstract":"The driving force behind deep networks is their ability to compactly represent rich classes of functions.
