Experiments show improved generalization over mini-batch SGD, which is the main positive aspect of this paper. The main algorithm has not been properly developed; there is too much focus on the convergence aspects of the inner iterations, for which there are many good algorithms already in the optimization literature. There are no good explanations for why the method yields better generalization. Overall, TR seems like an interesting idea, but it has neither been carefully expanded or investigated. \n\nLet me state the main interesting results before going into criticisms:\n1. TR method seems to generalize better than mini-batch SGD. \n2. TR seems to lose generalization more gracefully than SGD when batch size is increased. [But note here that mini-batch SGD is not a closed chapter. With better ways of adjusting the noise level via step-size control (larger step sizes mean more noise) the loss of generalization associated with large mini-batch sizes can be brought down. See, for example: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00489.pdf.]\n3. Hybrid method is even better. This only means that more understanding is needed as to how TR can be combined with SGD.\n\nTrust region methods are generally batch methods. Algorithm 1 is also stated from that thinking and it is a well-known optimization algorithm. The authors never mention mini-batch when Algorithm 1 is introduced. But the authors clearly have only the stochastic min-batch implementation of the algorithm in mind. \n\nOne has to wait till we go into the experiments section to read something like:\n\"Lastly, although in theory, we need full gradient and full Hessian to guarantee convergence, calculating them in each iteration is not practical, so we calculate both Hessian and gradient on subsampled data to replace the whole dataset\"\nfor readers to realize that the authors are talking about a stochastic mini-batch method. This is a bad way of introducing the main method. This stochastic version obviously requires a step size; so it would have been proper to state the stochastic version of the algorithm instead of the batch algorithm in Algorithm 1.\n\nInstead of saying that in passing why not explicitly state it in key places, including the abstract and title? I suggest TR be replaced by \"Stochastic TR\" everywhere. Also, what does \"step size\" mean in the TR method? I suggest that all these are fully clarified as parts of Algorithm 1 itself. \n\nTrust region subproblem (TRS) has been analyzed and developed so much in the optimization literature. For example, the conjugate gradient-based method leading to the Steihaug-Toint point is so much used. [Note: Here, the gradient refers to the gradient of the quadratic model, and it uses only Hessian-vector products.] http://www.ii.uib.no/~trond/publications/papers/trust.pdf. The authors spend so much effort developing their own algorithm! Also, in actual implementation, they only use a crude version of the inner algorithm for reasons of efficiency.\n\nThe paper does not say anything about the convergence of the full algorithm. How good are the trust region updates based on q_t given the huge variability associated with the mini-batch operation? The authors should look at several existing papers on stochastic trust region and stochastic quasi-Newton methods, e.g., papers from Katya Scheinberg (Lehigh) and Richard Byrd (Colorado)'s groups.\n\nThe best-claimed method of the method, called \"Hybrid method\" is also mentioned only in passing, and that too in a scratchy fashion (see end of subsec 4.3):\n\"To enjoy the best of both worlds, we also introduce a “hybrid” method in the Figure 3, that is, first run TR method for several epochs to get coarse solution and then run SGD for a while until fully converge. Our rule of thumb is, when the training accuracy raises slowly, run SGD for 10 epochs (because it’s already close to minimum). We find this “hybrid” method is both fast and accurate, for both small batch and large batch.\"\n\nExplanations of better generalization properties of TR over SGD are important. I feel this part is badly done in the paper. For example, there is this statement:\n\"We observe that our method (TR) converges to solutions with much better test error but\nworse training error when batch size is larger than 128. We postulate this is because SGD is easy to overfit training data and “stick” to a solution that has a high loss in testing data, especially with the large batch case as the inherent noise cannot push the iterate out of loss valley while our TR method can.\"\nFrankly, I am unable to decipher what is being said here.\n\nThere is an explanation indicating that switching from SGD to TR causes an uphill movement (which I presume, is due to the trust region radius r being large); but statements such as - this will lead to climbing over to a wide minimum etc. are too strong; no evidence is given for this.\n\nThere is a statement - \"even if the exact local minima is reached, the subsampled Hessian may still have negative curvature\" - again, there is no evidence.\n\nOverall, the paper only has a few interesting observations, but there is no good and detailed experimental analysis that help explain these observations.\n\nThe writing of the paper needs a lot of improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Better Generalization by Efficient Trust Region Method","abstract":"In this paper, we develop a trust region method for training deep neural networks.

The authors claim that this approach is better at avoiding \"narrow\" local optima, and therefore will tend to generalize better than minibatched SGD. The main novelty seems to be algorithm 2, which finds the minimizer of the quadratic approximation within the trust region by performing GD iterations until the boundary is hit (if it is--it might not, if the quadratic is convex), and then Riemannian GD along the boundary.\n\nThe paper contains several grammatical mistakes, and in my opinion could explain things more clearly, particularly when arguing that the algorithm 2 will converge. I had particular difficulty accepting that the phase 1 GD iterates would never hit the boundary if the quadratic was strongly convex, although I accept that it is true due to the careful choice of step size and initialization (assumptions 1 and 2).\n\nThe central claim of the paper, that a trust region method will be better at avoiding narrow basins, seems plausible, since if the trust region is sufficiently large then it will simply pass straight over them. But if this is the case, wouldn't that imply that the quadratic approximation to the objective function is poor, and therefore that line 5 of algorithm 1 should shrink the trust region radius? Additionally, at some times the authors seem to indicate that the trust region method should be good at escaping from narrow basins (as opposed to avoiding them in the first place), see for example the left plot of figure 4. I don't see why this is true--the quadratic approximation would be likely to capture the narrow basin only.\n\nThis skepticism aside, the experiments in figure 2 do clearly show that, while the proposed approach doesn't converge nearly as quickly as SGD in terms of training loss, it does ultimately find a solution that generalizes better, as long as both SGD and TR use the same batch size (but I don't see why they should be using the same batch size). How does SGD with a batch size of 1 compare to TR with the batch sizes of 512 (CIFAR10) or 1024 (STL10)?\n\nSection 4.3 (Figure 3) contain a very nice experiment that I think directly explores this issue, and seems to show that SGD with a batch size of 64 generalizes better than TR at any of the considered batch sizes (but not as well as the proposed TR+SGD hybrid). Furthermore, 64 was the smallest batch size considered, but SGD was performing monotonically better as the batch size decreased, so one would expect it to be still better for 32, 16, etc.\n\nSmaller comments:\n\nYou say that you base the Hessian and gradient estimates on minibatched samples. I assume that the same is true for the evaluations of F on line 4 of Algorithm 1? Do these all use the same minibatch, at each iteration?\n\nOn the top of page 3: \"M is the matrix size\". Is this the number of elements, or the number of rows/columns?\n\nLemma 1: This looks correct to me, but are these the KKT conditions, which I understand to be first order optimality conditions (these are second order)? You cite Nocedal & Wright, but could you please provide a page number (or at least a chapter)?\n\nOn the top of page 5, \"Line 10 of Algorithm 1\": I think you mean Line 11 of Algorithm 2.","confidence":"2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Better Generalization by Efficient Trust Region Method","abstract":"In this paper, we develop a trust region method for training deep neural networks.
