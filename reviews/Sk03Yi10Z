The authors also apply a reranking-based approach to ensembling based on a gradient-boosted decision tree classifier.\nBut their multi-seq2seq model is not particularly well-justified with evaluations and examples (as compared with the reranking/ensemble, which is essentially a standard approach) and it's unclear whether it helps more than other recent approaches to response diversity.\n\nSome additional points:\n1. For several of the GBDT features, the approach chosen is unusual or perhaps outdated. In particular, the choice of a word-level MT-based metric rather than an utterance-level one, and the choice of a bigram-based fluency metric rather than one based on a more complete language model are puzzling and should be justified.\n2. The authors report primarily comparisons to ablations of their own model, not to other recent work in dialog systems.\n3. The human evaluation performance of a simple reranking ensemble between the authors' generation-based model and their retrieval-based model is significantly higher than multi-seq2seq, suggesting that multi-seq2seq may not be an especially powerful way to combine information from the two models.\n4. The authors present only very limited examples (in Table 4) and one out of the two multi-seq2seq examples in that table is relatively nonsensical. When the original examples are non-English, papers should also include the original in addition to a translation.","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"An Ensemble of Retrieval-Based and Generation-Based Human-Computer Conversation Systems.","abstract":"Human-computer conversation systems have attracted much attention in Natural Language Processing.

Answers are produced in three phases: a retrieval-based model extracts candidate answers; a generator model, conditioned on retrieved answers, produces an additional candidate; a reranker outputs the best among all candidates.\n\nThe approach is interesting: the proposed ensemble can improve on both the retrieval module and the generation module, since it does not restrict modeling power (e.g. the generator is not forced to be consistent with the candidates). I am not aware of similar approaches for this task. One work that comes to mind regarding the blend of retrieval and generation is Memory Networks (e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03126.pdf and references): given a query, a set of relevant memories is extracted from a KB using an inverted index and the memories are fed into the generator. However, the extracted items in the current work are candidate answers which are used both to feed the generator and to participate in reranking.\n\nThe experimental section focuses on the task of building conversational systems. The performance measures used are 1) a human evaluation score with three volunteers and 2) BLUE scores. While these methods are not very satisfying, effective evaluation of such systems is a known difficulty. \n\nThe results show that the ensemble outperforms the individual modules, indicating that: the multi-seq2seq models have learned to use the new inputs as needed and that the ranker is correlated with the evaluation metrics.\n\nHowever, the results themselves do not look impressive to me: the subjective evaluation is close to the \"borderline\" score; in the examples provided, one is good, the other is borderline/bad, and the baseline always provides something very short. Does the LSTM work particularly poor on this dataset? Given that this is a novel dataset, I don't know what the state-of-the-art should be. Could you provide more insight? Have you considered adding a benchmark dataset (e.g. a QA dataset)?\n\nSpecific questions:\n\n1. The paper motivates conditioning on the candidates in two ways. First, that the candidates bring additional information which the decoder can use (e.g. read from the candidates locations, actions, etc.). Second, that the probability of universal replies must decrease due to the additional condition. I think the second argument depends on how the conditioning is performed: if the candidates are simply appended to the input, the model can learn to ignore them.\n2. The copy mechanism is a nice touch, encouraging the decoder to use the provided queries. Why not copy from the query too, e.g. with some answers reusing part of the query <\"Where are you going?\", \"I'm going to the park\">?\n3. How often does the model select the generated answer vs. the extracted answers? In both examples provided the selected answer is the one merging the candidate answers.\n\nMinor issues:\n- Section 3.2: using and the state\n- Section 3.2: more than one replies\n- last sentence on page 3: what are the \"following principles\"?","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"An Ensemble of Retrieval-Based and Generation-Based Human-Computer Conversation Systems.","abstract":"Human-computer conversation systems have attracted much attention in Natural Language Processing.
