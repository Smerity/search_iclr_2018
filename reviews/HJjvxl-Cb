It implements the well-studied idea of RL with Entropy bonus. The results on the control suit looks very promising, though the paper does not compare with the state-of-the-art variants of baseline. Also the implementation details of the algorithm is not completely provided. So it is difficult to fully assess  the empirical results.","rating":"5: Marginally below acceptance threshold","review":"Quality and clarity: \n\nIt seems that the authors can do a better job to improve the readability of the paper and its conciseness. The current structure of paper seems a bit suboptimal to me. The first 6.5 page of the paper is used to explain the idea of RL with entropy  reward and how it can be extended to the case of parametrized value function and policy and then the whole experimental results  is packed  in only 1 page.  I think the paper could be organized in a more balanced way  by providing a more detailed description and analysis of the numerical results, especially given the fact that in my opinion this is the main strength of the paper.  Finally some of the claims made in this paper is not really justified. For instance \"Prior deep RL methods based on this framework have been formulated as either off-policy Q-learning, or on-policy policy gradient methods\" not true, e.g., look at  Deepmind AI recent work:  https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04651.\n\nOriginality and novelty:\n\nI think much of the ideas considered in this paper is already explored in previous work as it is acknowledged  in the paper.  However some of the techniques such as the way the policy is  represented  and the way the policy gradient formulation is approximated  seems to be novel in the context of Deep RL though again these ideas have been explored in the literature of control and RL extensively.  \n\nSignificance:\n\nI think the improvement on baseline in control suites is very impressive the problem is that the details of the implementation of algorithm e.g. architecture of neural network size of memory replay, the schedule the target network  is implemented is not sufficiently explained in the paper so it is  difficult to evaluate these results. Also the paper only compares with the original version of the baseline algorithms. These algorithms are improved since then and the new more efficient algorithms such as distributional policy gradients and NAF have been developed. So it would help to have a better understanding of this result if the paper compares with the state-of-the-art baselines. \n\nMinor:\nfor some reason different algorithms have ran for different number of steps which is a bit confusing. would be great if this is fixed in the future version.

It is a direct extension of maximum entropy reinforcement learning for Q-learning (recently called soft-Q learning), and named soft actor-critic (SAC). Empirically SAC is shown to outperform DDPG significantly in terms of stability and sample efficiency, and can solve relatively difficult tasks that previously only on-policy (or hybrid on-policy/off-policy) method such as TRPO/PPO can solve stably. Besides entropy regularization, it also introduces multi-modal policy parameterization through mixture of Gaussians that enables diverse, on-policy exploration.     \n\nThe main appeal of the paper is the strong empirical performance of this new off-policy method in continuous action benchmarks. Several design choices could be the key, so it is encouraged to provide more ablation studies on these, which would be highly valuable for the community. In particular,\n\n- Amortization of Q and \\pi through fitting state value function\n\n- On-policy exploration vs OU process based off-policy exploration\n\n- Mixture vs non-mixture-based stochastic policy\n\n- SAC vs soft Q-learning\n\nAnother valuable discussion to be had is the stability of off-policy algorithm comparing Q-learning versus actor-critic method.\n \nPros:\n\n- Simple off-policy algorithm that achieves significantly better performance than existing off-policy baseline algorithms\n\n- It allows on-policy exploration in off-policy learning, partially thanks to entropy regularization that prevents variance from shrinking to 0. It could be considered a major success of off-policy algorithm that removes heuristic exploration noise.\n\nCons:\n\n- Method is relatively simple extension from existing work in maximum entropy reinforcement learning. It is unclear what aspects lead to significant improvements in performance due to insufficient ablation studies. \n\n\nOther question:\n\n- Above Eq. 7 it discusses that fitting a state value function wrt Q and \\pi is shown to improve the stability significantly. Is this comparison with directly estimating state value using finite samples? If so, is the primary instability due to variance of the estimate, which can be avoided by drawing a lot of samples or do full integration (still reasonably tractable for finite mixture model)? Or, is the instability from elsewhere? By having SGD-based fitting of state value function, it appears to simulate slowly changing target values (similar role as target networks). If so, could a similar technique be used with DDPG and get more stable performance? \n\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Soft Actor-Critic: Off-Policy Maximum Entropy Deep Reinforcement Learning with a Stochastic Actor","abstract":"Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been demonstrated on a range of challenging decision making and control tasks.

However, the current paper has some correctness issues, is missing some related work and lacks a clear statement of innovation. \n\nThe first issue is that augmenting reward by adding an entropy term to the original RL objective is not clearly innovative. The connections, and improvements upon, other approaches need to be made more clear. In particular, the connection to the work by Haarnoja is unclear. There is this statement: “Although the soft Q-learning algorithm proposed by Haarnoja et al. (2017) has a value function and actor network, it is not a true actor-critic algorithm: the Q- function is estimating the optimal Q-function, and the actor does not directly affect the Q-function except through the data distribution. Hence, Haarnoja et al. (2017) motivates the actor network as an approximate sampler, rather than the actor in an actor-critic algorithm. Crucially, the convergence of this method hinges on how well this sampler approximates the true posterior. In contrast, we prove that our method converges to the optimal policy from a given policy class, regardless of the policy parameterization.” The last sentence suggests that the key difference is that any policy parameterization can be used, making the previous sentences less clear. Is the key extension on the proof, and so on the use of the projection with the KL-divergence?\n\nFurther, there is a missing connection to the paper “Guided policy search”, Levine and Koltun. Though it is a different framework, it clearly mentioned it uses the augmented reward to learn the sub-optimal policies (for differential dynamic program). The DDPG paper mentioned that DDPG can be also used within the GPS framework. That work is different, but a discussion should nonetheless be included about connections. \n \nIf the key novelty in this work is an extension on the theory, to allow any policy parameterization, and empirical results demonstrating improved performance over Haarnoja et al., there appear to be correctness issues in both, as laid out below.\n\nThe key novelty in the theory seems to be to use a projection onto the space of policies, using a KL divergence. There are, however, currently too many unclear or misspecified steps to verify correctness.\n1. The definition of pinew in Equation (6) is for one specific state s_t; shouldn’t this be across all states? If it is for one state, then E_{pinew} makes sense, since pi is only specified as a conditional distribution (not a joint distribution); if it is supposed to be expected value across all states, then what is E_{pinew}? Is it with the stationary distribution of pinew?\n\n2. The proof for Lemma 1 is hard to follow, because Z is not defined. I mostly was able to guess, based on Haarnoja et al., but the step between (18) and (19) where E_{pinew} [Zpiold] -  E_{piold} [Zpiold] is dropped is unclear to me. Zpiold does not depend on actions, so if the expectation is only w.r.t. to the action, then it cancels. This goes back to point 1, where it wouldn’t make much sense for the KL to only depend on actions. In fact, if pinew has to be computed separately for each state, then we are really back to tabular policies.  \n\n3. “There is no need in principle to include a separate function approximator for the state value, since it is related to the Q-function and policy according to Qθ (st , at ) − log πφ (at |st )” This is not true, since you rely on the fact that you have separate network parameters to get an unbiased gradient estimate in (10). \n\nThe experimental results also appear to have some correctness issues. \n1. For the claim that the algorithm does better, this is also difficult to gauge because the graphs are unclear. In particular, it is not explained why the lines end early. How were multiple gradients incorporated into the update? Did you wait 4 (or 16) steps until computing a gradient update? This might explain why the lines end early, but then invalidates how the lines are drawn. Rather, the lines should be extended, where each point is plotted each 4 (or 16) steps. Doing this would remove the effect that the lines with 4 or 16 seem to learn faster (but really are just plotted on a different x-axis). \n\n2. There is a lack of experimental details. This includes missing details about neural network architectures used by each algorithm, parameter tuning details, how multiple gradients are used, etc. This omission makes the experiments not reproducible.\n\n3. Although DDPG is claimed to be very sensitive to parameter changes, and the proposed algorithm is more stable, there is no parameter sensitivity results showed. \n\nMinor comments:\n1. Graph font is much too small.\n2. Typo in (10), should be V(s_{t+1})\n3. Because the proof of Lemma 1 is so straightforward (just redefining reward), it would be better to actually spell it out, give a definition of entropy, etc. \n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Soft Actor-Critic: Off-Policy Maximum Entropy Deep Reinforcement Learning with a Stochastic Actor","abstract":"Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been demonstrated on a range of challenging decision making and control tasks.
