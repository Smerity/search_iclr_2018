Without doubt, we also agree that there could be cases where the generative model fits embarrassingly to the data, and yet inference is perfect. However, this does not hinder our analysis of the gaps according to our definitions (Section 3.1). We would also like to note that, although our calculations of the gaps are only estimates, such a amortization-approximation decomposition may be valuable to guiding improvements to approximate inference. \n\n\"What happens when the decoder is trained separately using more flexible inference (e.g. Hamiltonian MC) and the encoder is trained later?

I think this paper is still pretty borderline, but I increased my rating to a 6.\n=======\n\nThis article examines the two sources of loose bounds in variational autoencoders, which the authors term “approximation error” (slack due to using a limited variational family) and “amortization error” (slack due to the inference network not finding the optimal member of that family).\n\nThe existence of amortization error is often ignored in the literature, but (as the authors point out) it is not negligible. It has been pointed out before in various ways, however:\n* Hjelm et al. (2015; https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06382.pdf) observe it for directed belief networks (admittedly a different model class).\n* The ladder VAE paper by Sonderby et al. (2016, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.02282.pdf) uses an architecture that reduces the work that the encoder network needs to do, without increasing the expressiveness of the variational approximation. That this approach works well implies that amortization error cannot be ignored.\n* The structured VAE paper by Johnson et al. (2016, https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06277) also proposes an architecture that reduces the load on the inference network.\n* The very recent paper by Krishnan et al. (posted to arXiv days before the ICLR deadline, although a workshop version was presented at the NIPS AABI workshop last year; http://approximateinference.org/2016/accepted/KrishnanHoffman2016.pdf) examines amortization error as a core cause of training failures in VAEs. They also observe that the gap persists at test time, although it does not examine how it relates to approximation error.\n\nSince these earlier results existed, and approximation-amortization decomposition is fairly simple (although important!), the main contributions of this paper are the empirical studies. I will try to summarize the main novel (i.e., not present elsewhere in the literature) results of these:\n\nSection 5.1:\nInference networks with FFG approximations can produce qualitatively embarrassing approximations.\n\nSection 5.2:\nWhen trained on a small dataset, training amortization error becomes negligible. I found this surprising, since it’s not at all clear why dataset size should lead to “strong inference”. It seems like a more likely explanation is that the decoder doesn’t have to work as hard to memorize the training set, so it has some extra freedom to make the true posterior look more like a FFG.\n\nAlso, I think it’s a bit of an exaggeration to call a gap of 2.71 nats “much tighter” than a gap of 3.01 nats.\n\nSection 5.3:\nAmortization error is an important contributor to the slack in the ELBO on MNIST, and the dominant contributor on the more complicated Fashion MNIST dataset. (This is totally consistent with Krishnan et al.’s finding that eliminating amortization error gave a bigger improvement for more complex datasets than for MNIST.)\n\nSection 5.4:\nUsing a restricted variational family causes the decoder to learn to induce posteriors that are easier to approximate with that variational family. This idea has been around for a long time (although I’m having a hard time coming up with a reference).\n\nThese results are interesting, but given the empirical nature of this paper I would have liked to see results on more interesting datasets (Celeb-A, CIFAR-10, really anything but MNIST). Also, it seems as though none of the full-dataset MNIST models have been trained to convergence, which makes it a bit difficult to interpret some results.\n\n\nA few more specific comments:\n\n2.2.1: The \\cdot seems extraneous to me.\n\n5.1: What dataset/model was this experiment done on?\n\nFigure 3: This can be inferred from the text (I think), but I had to remind myself that “IW train” and “IW test” refer only to the evaluation procedure, not the training procedure. It might be good to emphasize that you don’t train on the IWAE bound in any experiments.\n\nTable 2: It would be good to see standard errors on these numbers; they may be quite high given that they’re only evaluated on 100 examples.\n\n“We can quantitatively determine how close the posterior is to a FFG distribution by comparing the Optimal FFG bound and the Optimal Flow bound.”: Why not just compare the optimal with the AIS evaluation?

Inference networks, in general, have two sources of approximation errors. One due to the function family of variational posterior distributions used in inference and the other due to choosing to amortize inference rather than doing per-data-point inference as in SVI.\n\nThey consider learning VAEs using two different choices of inference networks with (1) fully factorized Gaussian and (2) normalizing flows. The former is the de-facto choice of variational approximation used in VAEs and the latter is capable of expressing complex multi-modal distributions.\n\nThe inference gap is log p(x) - L[q], the approximation gap is log p(x) - L[q^* ] and the amortization gap is L[q^* ] - L[q]. The amortization gap is easily evaluated. To evaluate the first two, the authors use estimates (lower bounds of log p(x)) given from annealed importance sampling and the importance sampling based IWAE bound (the tighter of the two is used).\n\nThere are several different observations made via experiments in this work but one of the more interesting ones is quantifying that a deep generative model, when trained with a fully factorized gaussian posterior, realizes a true posterior distribution that is (more) approximately Gaussian. While this might be (known) intuition that people rely on when learning deep generative models, it is important to be able to test it, as this paper does. The authors study several discrete questions about the aforementioned inference gaps and how they vary on MNIST and FashionMNIST. The concerns I have about this work revolve around their choice of two small datasets and how much their results are affected by variance in the estimators.\n\nQuestions:\n* How did you optimize the variational parameters for q^* and the flow parameters in terms of learning rate, stopping criteria etc.\n* In Section 5.2, what is \"strong inference\"? This is not defined previously.\n* Have you evaluated on a larger dataset such as CIFAR? FashionMNIST and MNIST are similar in many ways.\n* Which kind of error would using a convolution architecture for the encoder decrease? Do you have insights on the role played by the architecture of the inference network and generative model?\n\nI have two specific concerns:\n* Did you perform any checks to verify whether the variance in the estimators use to bound log p(x) is controlled (for the specific # samples you use)? I'm concerned since the evaluation is only done on 100 points.\n* In Section 5.2.1, L_iw is used to characterize encoder overfitting where the argument is that L_ais is not a function of the encoder, but L_iw is, and so the difference between the two summarizes how much the inference network has overfit. How is L_iw affected by the number of samples used in the estimator? Presumably this statement needs to be made while also keeping mind the number of importance samples. For example, if I increase the number of importance samples, even if I'm overfitting in Fig 3(b), wouldn't the green line move towards the red simply because my estimator depends less on a poor q?\n\nOverall, I think this paper is interesting and presents a quantitative analysis of where the errors accrue due to learning with inference networks. The work can be made stronger by addressing some of the questions above such as what role is played by the neural architecture and whether the results hold up under evaluation on a larger dataset.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Inference Suboptimality in Variational Autoencoders","abstract":"Amortized inference has led to efficient approximate inference for large datasets.

They perform various experiments to analyze how these quantities depend on modeling decisions and data sets.\n\nBreaking down the inference gap into its components is an interesting idea and could potentially provide insights when analyzing VAE performance and for further improving VAEs. I enjoyed reading the paper, but I think its contribution is on the small side for a conference paper. It would be a good workshop paper. The main limitation of the proposed method of analysis I think is that the two parts of the inference gap are not really separable: Because the VAE encoder is trained jointly with the decoder, the different limitations of the encoder and decoder all interact. E.g. one could imagine cases where jointly training the VAE encoder and decoder finds a local optimum where inference is perfect, but which is still much worse than the optimum that could be achieved if the encoder would have been more flexible. The authors do seem to realize this and they provide experiments examining this interaction. I think these experiments should be elaborated on. For example: What happens when the decoder is trained separately using more flexible inference (e.g. Hamiltonian MC) and the encoder is trained later? What happens when the encoder is optimized separately for each data point during training as well as testing?","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Inference Suboptimality in Variational Autoencoders","abstract":"Amortized inference has led to efficient approximate inference for large datasets.
