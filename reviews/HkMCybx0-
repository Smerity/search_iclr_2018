It then argues that speeding up the activation function may be important since the convolution operations in CNNs are becoming heavily optimized and may form a lesser fraction of the overall computation. The ISRLU is then reported to be 2.6x faster compared to ELU using AVX2 instructions. The possibility of computing a faster approximation of ISRLU is also mentioned.\nPreliminary experimental results are reported which demonstrate that ISRLU can perform similar to ELU.\n\nQuality and significance:\nThe paper proposes an interesting direction for optimizing the computational cost of training and inference using neural networks. However, on one hand the contribution is rather narrow, and on the other the results presented do not clearly show that the contribution is of significance in practice.\nThe paper does not present clear benchmarks showing a) what is the fraction of CPU cycles spent in evaluating the activation function in any reasonably practical neural network, b) and what is the percentage of cycles saved by employing the ISRLU.\nThe presented results using small networks on the MNIST dataset only show that networks with ISRLU can perform similar to those with other activation functions, but not the speed advantages of ISRLU.\nThe effect of using the faster approximation on performance also remains to be investigated.\n\nClarity:\nThe content of the paper is unclear in certain areas.\n- It is not clear what Table 2 is showing. What is \"performance\" measured in? In general the Table captions need to be clearer and more descriptive. The acronym pkeep in later Tables should be clarified.\n- Why is the final Cross-Entropy Loss so high even though the accuracy is >99% for the MNIST experiments? It looks like the loss at initialization was reported instead?","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Improving Deep Learning by Inverse Square Root Linear Units (ISRLUs)","abstract":"We introduce the “inverse square root linear unit” (ISRLU) to speed up learning in deep neural networks.

The paper also shows major speedup compared to ELU and TANH (unit-wise speedup).\n\nPros:\n- The proposed function has similar behavior as ELU but 4x cheaper.\n- The authors also refer us to faster ways to compute square root functions numerically, which can be of general interests to the community for efficient network designs in the future.\n- The paper is clearly written and key contributions are well present.\n\nCons:\n- Clearly, the proposed function is not faster than ReLU. In the introduction, the authors explain the motivation that ReLU needs centered activation (such as BN). But the authors also need to justify that ISRLU (or ELU) doesn’t need BN. In fact, in a recent study of ELU-ResNet (Shah et al., 2016) finds that ELU without BN leads to gradient explosion. To my knowledge, BN (at least in training time) is much more expensive than the activation function itself, so the speedup get from ISRLU may be killed by using BN in deeper networks on larger benchmarks. At inference time, all of ReLU, ELU, and ISRLU can fuse BN weights into convolution weights, so again ISRLU will not be faster than ReLU. The core question here is, whether the smoothness and centered zero property of ELU can buy us any win, compared to ReLU? I couldn’t find it based on the results presented here.\n- The authors need to validate on larger datasets (e.g. CIFAR, if not ImageNet) so that their proposed methods can be widely adopted.\n- The speedup is only measured on CPU. For practical usage, especially in computer vision, GPU speedup is needed to show an impact.\n\nConclusion:\n- Based on the comments above, I recommend weak reject.\n\nReferences:\n- Shah, A., Shinde, S., Kadam, E., Shah, H., Shingade, S..

However, they only show the reduction of computation complexity for convolution, and speed comparison between ReLU, ISRLU and ELU on high-end CPU. As far as I know, even though modern CNNs have reduced convolution’s computation complexity, the computation cost of activation function is still only a very small part (less than 1%) in the overall running time of training/inference. \n\n(2) Authors only experimented with two very simple CNN architectures and with three different nonlinear activation functions, i.e., ISRLU/ELU/ReLU and showed their accuracies on MNIST.

These can improve performance for Exp.  The implementations you pointed at were 64-bit approximations. While most DNN is done in 32-bit, 16-bit, etc.  They took a few other optimization that you pointed to such as no bounds checking (which is probably ok for a well-designed AI implementation.  Also these were scalar implementations) and they not vector implementations which depending on the hardware may  bring up issues.\n\nAnother way to get faster intrinsic performance is various lower-precision implementations. In fact. we've even coded up some of our low lower-precisions intrinsics ourselves. For some background we'd suggest the classic: J.Hart, E.W. Cheney, et al, Computer Approximations, Publisher: Krieger Pub Co (July 1, 1978), ISBN-10: 0882756427 Side note: you should \"reshoot\" your own Chebyshev coefficients using Remez (not using the co-efficents in the book)\n\nBut the bottom line is that inverse-square root, as mentioned in the paper has been faster than exp. \n\nWith an approximation you can then basically double the number of bits of accuracy with each Newton-Raphson iteration, which is easy to vectorize and does not increase the flop count too much.  \n\nThe other point we made in the paper is that ISRLU has a very natural way to introduce an alpha that is smooth and continuous for 1st/2nd derivatives.  Yes there are other ways of introducing alpha into ELU functions (https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07483) but we still find ISRLU more natural.\n\nThanks for you comment, we hope that ISRLU & ISRU be considered especially for purpose-built AI DNN hardware."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Improving Deep Learning by Inverse Square Root Linear Units (ISRLUs)","abstract":"We introduce the “inverse square root linear unit” (ISRLU) to speed up learning in deep neural networks.
