Our penalty scheme helps avoid bad local equilibria and the convex-concave case, while being simple, is quite different from the non-convex case.\n\n- We changed section 2.3 to rigorously argue that regret minimization converges to (potentially bad) local equilibria, added a new section 2.4 to characterize what these 'mode collapse' equilibria look like (D has large gradients around real samples in this case) and demonstrate that they can be averted using gradient constraints, through new toy experiments. This provides good intuition and a strong motivation for the introduction of DRAGAN scheme. We urge you to take another look at sections 2.3, 2.4.\n\n- In the updated revision, we correct this arbitrary choice and use 'k', which should be something small. Basically, we observe that 'mode collapse' equilibria exhibit sharp gradients of the discriminator function around real samples. So, we regularize so as to keep these gradients small. We apologize for not making it clear earlier. \n\n- You make an excellent point that by tuning 'k'/'c'/'lambda', it could be possible to get better performance but our aim here was just to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. My intuition is that optimal configuration will depend on data domain, architecture and hence, its beyond the scope of our paper. But, this is an important topic for possibly a future work.\n\n- We only explore the performance of our penalty on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CelebA, like most papers in this direction. I think the performance on ImageNet depends heavily on the architecture but we did not explore this aspect in our paper.

But our penalty (local penalty) is also quite different from WGAN-GP and LS-GAN (coupled penalties, both of these are shown to be very similar in our paper) as we only regularize in local regions around the real data. We dedicate the entire section 2.5 to compare/contrast these methods. \n\n- Further, we discuss how WGAN-GP's gradient penalty has little to do with Wasserstein duality as claimed in their paper (please see section 2.5) and in fact, this adds more credence to our theory that keeping D(x) gradients around real data to be small, is how they mitigate mode collapse. \n\n- The explanation for why constraining D(x)'s gradients around real data helps, is provided in section 2.4. And adding this penalty to the cost function of D and performing gradient descent w.r.t parameters, encourages the player to learn smooth functions which is what we want. This same idea has been used in Gulrajani et.al, Qi et.al as well. It would be interesting to come up with architectural design principles that inherently result in smooth discriminator functions. \n\n- We observed that 'mode collapse' equilibria exhibit sharp gradients of the discriminator function around real points and hence, we propose regularizing D (a gradient penalty scheme). Our work does not study mode collapse from the generator's perspective but what you propose is an excellent research direction. I think the method to achieve stability will look very different if one takes that approach since the generator's architecture is significantly different.\n\n- Our work mainly deals with the question of why mode collapse happens from 'regret minimization' perspective. And connect that to gradient penalties for constraining D's gradients in the data space. Our work was done prior to Roth et.al and so, we were only able to compare with WGAN-GP. But they also suggest a similar gradient penalty.\n\n- This is an excellent point that one should perform annealing of lamdba to get the best results using regularization schemes. However, we focus in our paper on why mode collapse happens, how we can characterize it and methods to avoid it. As long as D(x) has small gradients around real data, mode collapse can be averted. Our aim was not to get the best experimental results, and we only wanted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme.\n\n\nBogoNet Score:\n\n- We did observe architectures where both the methods performed well and cases where both of them failed. To nullify the effect of such non-differentiating architectures, our bounty model awards 2.5 points each (out of 5) in such cases. \n\n- This experiment was only done using the standard CIFAR-10 dataset. Due to the constraints on GPU resources available to us, we couldn't try different datasets. Especially, since we included ResNets in the experiment which take days to train.

This is a completely novel contribution. In contrast, the popular view is that there is consistent divergence minimization and this is based on the unrealistic assumption that the discriminator is playing optimally at each step and making these updates in the function space. This isn't tractable (nor) close to what happens in practice. This forms the main motivation for our paper.\n\n- We present the analysis of artificial convex-concave case based on standard results in game theory literature. More importantly, we make explicit the connection between GAN training process (alternating gradient updates) and regret minimization, along the way, in section 2.2. These are not widely known results in the GAN literature and we provide supporting references in the new revision.\n\n**The useful outcome is that this analysis yields a novel proof for the asymptotic convergence of GAN training in the non-parametric limit and it does not require the discriminator to be optimal at each step**\nThe current revision reflects this message. \n\n- To explain mode collapse, we next analyze the realistic non-convex case in section 2.3 from regret minimization perspective. This is very different from the convex-concave case actually (we apologize for the confusion) and we cite the works of Hazan et.al to rigorously argue that convergence to potentially bad local equilibria happens using gradient updates (under some conditions).

We apologize for not being clear earlier. The natural question now is how we can avoid these equilibria? \n\n- A new section 2.4 has been added which explains how we can avoid 'mode collapse' equilibria (this was implicit and not clear earlier). Based on empirical observations, we basically characterize 'mode collapse' equilibria with sharp gradients of the discriminator function around some real data points. This is key to fighting mode collapse and avoiding such undesirable equilibria. We provide arguments and supporting experiments for this in a new section 2.4. This was a key transition that was missing in the earlier version.\n\n- From this motivation (of keeping D's gradients small in ambient data space), we propose DRAGAN penalty scheme. In fact, our theory also explains how other gradient penalties (WGAN-GP/LS-GAN) might be mitigating mode collapse. We compare and discuss its advantages over them in section 2.5.

I am not saying ideas are not interesting, but I think the author needs to choose the main point of the paper, and should focus on delivering in-depth studies on the main point.\n\n1. On the game theoretic interpretations \n\nThe paper, Generative Adversarial Nets, NIPS 2014, already presented the game theoretic interpretations to GANs, so it's hard for me to think what's new in the section. Best response dynamics is not used in the conventional GAN training, because it's very hard to find the global optimal of inner minimization and outer maximization.\nThe convergence of online primal-dual gradient descent method in the minimax game is already well-known, but this analysis cannot be applied to the usual GAN setting because the objective is not convex-concave. I found this analysis would be very interesting if the authors can find the toy example when GAN becomes convex-concave by using different model parameterizations and/or different f-divergence, and conduct various studies on the convergence and stability on this problem.\n\nI also found that the hypothesis on the model collapsing has very limited connection to the convex-concave case. It is OK to form the hypothesis and present an interesting research direction, but in order to make this as a main point of the paper, the author should provide more rigorous arguments or experimental studies instead of jumping to the hypothesis in two sentences. For example, if the authors can provide the toy example where GAN becomes convex-concave vs. non-convex-concave case, and how the loss function shape or gradient dynamics are changing, that will provide very valuable insights on the problem. \n\n2. DRAGAN\n\nAs open commenters pointed out, I found it's difficult to find why we want to make the norm of the gradient to 1.\nWhy not 2? why not 1/2? Why 1 is very special?\nIn the WGAN paper, the gradient is clipped to a number less than 1, because it is a sufficient condition to being 1-Lipshitz, but this paper provides no justification on this number.\nIt's OK not to have the theoretical answers to the questions but in that case the authors should provide ablation experiments. For example, sweeping gradient norm target from 10^-3, 10^-2, 10^-1, 1.0, 10.0, etc and their impact on the performance.\nAlso scheduling regularization parameter like reducing the size of lambda exponentially would be interesting as well.\nMost of those studies won't be necessary if the theory is sound. However, since this paper does not provide a justification on the magic number \"1\", I think it's better to include some form of ablation studies.\n\nNote that the item 1 and item 2 are not strongly related to each other, and can be two separate papers. I recommend to choose one direction and provide in-depth study on one topic. Currently, this paper tries to present interesting ideas without very deep investigations, and I cannot recommend this paper to be published.\n","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"On Convergence and Stability of GANs","abstract":"We propose studying GAN training dynamics as regret minimization, which is in contrast to the popular view that there is consistent minimization of a divergence between real and generated distributions.

As many other papers, they suggest adding a regularization penalty on the discriminator which penalizes the gradient with respect to the data, effectively linearizing the data manifold.\n\nRelevance: Although I think some of the empirical results provided in the paper are interesting, I doubt the scientific contribution of this paper is significant. First of all, the penalty the author suggest is the same as the one suggest by Gulrajani for Wasserstein GAN (there the motivation behind this penalty comes from the optimal transport plan). In this paper, the author apply the same penalty to the GAN objective with the alternative update rule which is also a lower-bound for the Wasserstein distance.\n\nJustification: The authors justify the choice of their regularization saying it linearizes the objective along the data manifold and claim it reduces the number of non-optimal fixed points. This might be true in the data space but the GAN objective is optimized over the parameter space and it is therefore not clear to me their argument hold w.r.t to the network parameters. Can you please comment on this?\n\nRegularizing the generator: Can the authors motivate their choice for regularizing the discriminator only, and not the generator? Following their reasoning of linearizing the objective, the same argument should apply to the generator.\n\nComparison to existing work: This is not the first paper that suggests adding a regularization. Given that the theoretical aspect of the paper are rather weak, I would at least expect a comparison to existing regularization methods, e.g.\nStabilizing training of generative adversarial networks through regularization. NIPS, 2017\n\nChoice of hyper-parameters: The authors say that the suggested value for lambda is 10. Can you comment on the choice of this parameter and how it affect the results? Have you tried  annealing lambda? This is a common procedure in optimization (see e.g. homotopy or continuation methods).\n\nBogonet score: I very much like the experiment where the authors select 100 different architectures to compare their method against the vanilla GAN approach. I here have 2 questions:\n- Did you do a deeper examination of your results, e.g. was there some architectures for which none of the method performed well?\n- Did you try to run this experiment on other datasets?\n","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"On Convergence and Stability of GANs","abstract":"We propose studying GAN training dynamics as regret minimization, which is in contrast to the popular view that there is consistent minimization of a divergence between real and generated distributions.

Is this possible to improve the performance if we put an additional hyper-parameter instead?\n\n- Are the performances greatly impacted by other value of lambda and c (the suggested parameter values are lambda = c = 10)?\n\n- As mentioned in the paper, the regularization affects the modeling performance.

DRAGAN's regularization is a simple constraint on the discriminator that is used to improve stability. It comes at a cost though! However, as we write at the end of section 2.4, by carefully choosing how you regularize, you can gain stability without losing too much performance. \n\nAnd though we suggest a hyperparameter setting for mostly image datasets in our paper, it doesn't work for all the distributions possible in all domains. Some tuning is required especially if your domain changes too much (from pixel space) or if the game/players are simple enough, I suggest also reducing the regularization intensity. I think the problem you observed is caused by this (see point 2). \n\n(In hindsight, we should have added a couple of points in Algorithm section to help practitioners use it. We will do so in the final version.)\n\n2. We show experiments on simple toy datasets in our paper without any issues. Since your domain is [-1,1] (not pixel space) and you are using small networks, I suggest not using default hyperparameters. Reduce 'c' first to something less than 0.1 (say). Further, if you want the best performance, I suggest tuning 'lambda' as well. Understanding what these hyperparameters are doing is essential to use DRAGAN to your advantage - c (size of local regions) and lambda (how much you want to bias). I can take a look at your code or share sample code after the review process :)\n\nEdit: I just realized your training data is uniform in [-1,1].

In the final course project, we tried to investigate the effects of different regularizations on GAN and WGAN. The two main regularization methods include the one proposed as DRAGAN in this paper and the one proposed in \"ON THE REGULARIZATION OF WASSERSTEIN GANS\" (referred to as w_reg in the following).\n\nWe mainly investigated the following methods: 1a. WGAN with weight clipping, 1b. WGAN with gradient penalty, 1c. WGAN with DRAGAN regularization, 1d. WGAN with w_reg; 2a. GAN, 2b. GAN with DRAGAN regularization.\n\nSince the generated images can only be judged with visualization, besides the image experiments, we also did some experiments on some simple synthetic cases. One exercise is to generate a [-1,1] uniform distribution from a Gaussian distribution. We observed the following results: all the methods 1a-2a are good at generating this simple distribution. However, GAN with the DRAGAN regularization does not. What we observed is that D(x) converges to a function with a hump and therefore all the generated samples are concentrated on a small region, instead of uniform distribution. We adopt a sample code from github. The generator has 2 layers and the discriminator has 1 layer.  The lambda is 10.\n\nWe got stuck in the observation for a long time. Later we find out the reason is the regularization term pushes the function to have some slope at the data support, which results in the hump shape. Therefore, the generated samples are mostly concentrated in the region with a large D(x).\n\nI am wondering if the authors have similar experience with the synthetic data experiments? Sometimes, the quality of generated images are hard to judge. Some synthetic data experiments are also needed to verify the performance.

Let us first step back and assume the minimax problem is convex/concave in theta_d/theta_g. When we design the algorithm, we should find one that at least works for the ideal case, and then think about how to make it robust for the general case, when the problem is not convex/concave in theta_d/theta_g. I understand that adding the norm regularization in the data support would definitely alleviate mode collapse, because it artificially adds gradients to encourage the generator to generate the data samples.

As we explain at the end of section 2.4, one can constrain D in multiple ways and still improve stability. It should be clear from our paper that stability requires trading off modeling performance as flexible models come with game-theoretic problems.\n\nWe chose this specific form using our intuitions so as to have the least negative impact on modeling performance. Hence, we only apply constraints near real samples unlike other approaches. Next, we wanted that D be \"smooth\" in x-space to help the generator learn better and change gradually w.r.t theta so that game dynamics improves (see why FTRL works in previous section for intuitions regarding this). \n\nLet's see why our constraint achieves both of these. It is reasonable to expect that almost any small pixel-wise perturbation will make a given image less realistic. So we want that D(x) and D(x') to be different and to somewhat depend on how far x and x' themselves are. Thus, gradient should be greater than zero or the generator cannot learn to tell real images and the noise apart. Of course, you can play around with that parameter but we found that it doesn't matter much (atleast for stability). The gradual change in D w.r.t theta happens as these local perturbations act as auxiliary data points holding D down (in some sense) to prevent rapid changes.  \n\n2. To answer your second question, please look back to our section 2.3 where we outline the possibilities for theta and phi in non-convex settings. They can:\n\n-> Converge to an equilibrium (can be local)\n-> Cycle s.t averages converge\n-> Don't converge at all\n\nIf D(x) converges to optimal, notice that this means we are \"almost\" in a local equilibria. The cost function for G is now fixed and he will perform SGD updates until reaching a local minima mostly. This is usual deep learning and so, there's no question of instability due to the game! Whether this result is optimal depends on well-posedness of the game. This is where our paper comes in :) As we explain in our conclusion, the dynamics of GANs are not understood in the right perspective yet. Thinking of them as consistently estimating and minimizing JS-divergence or Wasserstein distance is not appropriate.\n\n "},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"On Convergence and Stability of GANs","abstract":"We propose studying GAN training dynamics as regret minimization, which is in contrast to the popular view that there is consistent minimization of a divergence between real and generated distributions.

We show that DRAGAN enables faster training, achieves improved stability with fewer mode collapses, and leads to generator networks with better modeling performance across a variety of architectures and objective functions.","pdf":"/pdf/24608c33989bcf23aa04ee0f61cf9098ccdf8fbe.pdf","TL;DR":"Analysis of convergence and mode collapse by studying GAN training process as regret minimization","paperhash":"anonymous|on_convergence_and_stability_of_gans","_bibtex":"@article{\n  anonymous2018on,\n  title={On Convergence and Stability of GANs},\n  author={Anonymous},\n  journal={International Conference on Learning Representations},\n  year={2018},\n  url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryepFJbA-}\n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper505/Authors"],"keywords":["GAN","Generative Adversarial Networks","Mode Collapse","Stability","Game Theory","Regret Minimization","Convergence","Gradient Penalty"]}},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1512932421656,"tcdate":1509124536175,"number":505,"cdate":1509739263540,"id":"ryepFJbA-","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"ryepFJbA-","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"On Convergence and Stability of GANs","abstract":"We propose studying GAN training dynamics as regret minimization, which is in contrast to the popular view that there is consistent minimization of a divergence between real and generated distributions. We analyze the convergence of GAN training from this new point of view to understand why mode collapse happens. We hypothesize the existence of undesirable local equilibria in this non-convex game to be responsible for mode collapse. We observe that these local equilibria often exhibit sharp gradients of the discriminator function around some real data points.
