Using data from 90% of monitoring stations, the predicted data were interpolated on a geographic coordinate grid of 0.25 degree across China. The correlation between the interpolated data and the remaining 10% of monitoring stations is 0.79. Researchers at Harvard University used satellite measurements of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), ground topography and so on to estimate pm2.5 in the area lacking of monitoring stations (Di (2017)). They obtained a coefficient of determination(r-squared) of 0.83. The accuracy of our interpolation is not much different from the results of using more data. So we think that the adjusted interpolation method for pm2.5 is still good enough for pm2.5 predictions.

Since the major contribution lies in the production of the data, it is required for the authors to justify the quality of data. How accurate they are? What are the error bounds in terms of devices of measurement? What is the measurement precision? There is no such discussion for the data source in this submission, and thus it would be really hard for the reviewer to judge the validity of the dataset. The authors claim this is the largest dataset of such purpose, but they didn't demonstrate that the smaller datasets offered previously is indeed less competitive.\n\nRe: Our data sources include CNEMC and NOAA. CNEMC uses the measured weight method to determine the air quality according to the standard HJB-2011, while NOAA uses many different method to measure different meteorological data. We added these information into section 2.3 as below: \nFor air quality data from CNEMC, according to the decription of HJ6, the measurement error is less than 10µg/m 3 . For meteorological data from NOAA, Quanzhi Ye validates the quality of Cloud data in Ye (2010). For example, the probability of below 30% forecast error is 63% for Paranal..\n-------\nYe, Q.-Z. 2011, Forecasting Cloud Cover and Atmospheric Seeing for Astronomical Observing: Application and Evaluation of the Global Forecast System, Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, 123, 113-124\n\n>2.

In our practical experience, the accuracy is not good. One of the air quality pollution warning was released on 27 October 2017 in Beijing, leading many people to cancel the outdoor activities, but the pollution did not come as predicted.

In this paper, we introduced a new dataset, entitled as AirNet, containing the 0.25 degree resolution grid map of mainland China, with more than two years of continued air quality measurement and meteorological data. We published this dataset as an open resource for machine learning researches and set up a baseline of a 5-day air pollution forecast. The results of experiments demonstrated that this dataset could facilitate the development of new algorithms on the air quality forecast.","pdf":"/pdf/e9812ba01ffc25d39cd4b0238c5560e3cab01db9.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|airnet_a_machine_learning_dataset_for_air_quality_forecasting","_bibtex":"@article{\n  anonymous2018airnet:,\n  title={AirNet: a machine learning dataset for air quality forecasting},\n  author={Anonymous},\n  journal={International Conference on Learning Representations},\n  year={2018},\n  url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkymMAxAb}\n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper442/Authors"],"keywords":[]}},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1514739735496,"tcdate":1509118487104,"number":442,"cdate":1509739299099,"id":"SkymMAxAb","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"SkymMAxAb","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"AirNet: a machine learning dataset for air quality forecasting","abstract":"In the past decade, many urban areas in China have suffered from serious air pollution problems, making air quality forecast a hot spot. Conventional approaches rely on numerical methods to estimate the pollutant concentration and require lots of computing power. To solve this problem, we applied the widely used deep learning methods. Deep learning requires large-scale datasets to train an effective model. In this paper, we introduced a new dataset, entitled as AirNet, containing the 0.25 degree resolution grid map of mainland China, with more than two years of continued air quality measurement and meteorological data. We published this dataset as an open resource for machine learning researches and set up a baseline of a 5-day air pollution forecast.
