In this low-dimensional space, nodes with similar local neighborhoods are close to each other even if they are far in graph distance.  The methodology of the paper is fine but the experiments section is weak and the paper misses clear connections to sociology.","rating":"5: Marginally below acceptance threshold","review":"The term \"structural equivalence\" is used incorrectly in the paper.  From sociology, two nodes with the same position are in an equivalence relation.  An equivalence, Q, is any relation that satisfies these three conditions:\n  - Transitivity: (a,b), (b,c) ∈ Q ⇒ (a,c) ∈Q\n  - Symmetry: (a, b) ∈ Q if and only if (b, a) ∈Q\n  - Reflexivity: (a, a) ∈Q\n\nThere are three deterministic equivalences: structural, automorphic, and regular.\n\nFrom Lorrain & White (1971), two nodes u and v are structurally equivalent if they have the same relationships to all other nodes.  Exact structural equivalence is rare in real-world networks.\n\nFrom Borgatti, et al. (1992) and Sparrow (1993), two nodes u and v are automorphically equivalent if all the nodes can be relabeled to form an isomorphic graph with the labels of u and v interchanged.\n\nFrom Everett & Borgatti (1992), two nodes u and v are regularly equivalent if they are equally related to equivalent others.\n\nParts of this statement are false: \"A notable example of such approaches is RolX (Henderson et al., 2012), which aims to recover a soft-clustering of nodes into a predetermined number of K distinct roles using recursive feature extraction (Henderson et al., 2011).\"  RolX (as described in KDD 2012 paper) uses MDL to automatically determine the number of roles.\n\nAs indicated above, this statement is also false: \"We note that RolX requires the number of desired structural classes as input, ...\".\n\nThe paper does not discuss how the free parameter d (which represents the number of evenly spaced sample points)  is chosen. \n\nThis statement is misleading: \"In particular, a small perturbation of the graph yields small perturbations of the eigenvalues.\"  What is considered a small perturbation?  One can delete an edge (seemingly a small perturbation) and change the eigenvalues of the Laplacian dramatically --  e.g., deleting an edge that increases the number of connected components.\n\nThe barbell graph experiment seemed contrived.  Why would one except such a graph to have 8 classes?  Why not 3?  One for cliques, one for the chain, and one for connectors of the clique to the chain.\n\nIn Section 4.2, how many roles were selected for RolX?\n\nThe paper states: \"Furthermore, nodes from different graphs can be embedded into the same space and their structural roles can be compared across different graphs.\"  Experiments were not conducted to see how the competing approaches such as RolX compare with GraphWave on transfer learning tasks.\n\nGilpin et al (KDD 2013) extended RolX to incorporate sparsity and diversity constraints on the role space and showed that their approach is superior to RolX on measuring distances.  This is applicable to experiments in Figure 4.\n\nI strongly recommend running experiments that test the predictive power of the roles found by GraphWave.\n","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Spectral Graph Wavelets for Structural Role Similarity in Networks","abstract":"Nodes residing in different parts of a graph can have similar structural roles within their local network topology.
