We give our major clarifications points here.\n\n “Minimal contribution”:\nIn essence, our paper has three main contributions:\n1) proposing simple update rules for learning task relationship \nUnlike in (Jawanpuria 2015), we proposed simple sequential updates for learning task relationship matrix in addition to satisfying its positive semi-definite constraint at each iteration.  These update equations are unique to online lifelong learning setting and doesn’t require access to the entire input kernel matrix. The proposed algorithm can easily scales to large datasets with many tasks.\n\n2) incorporating task relationship in the budgeted scheme \nOur proposed scheme consists of a simple removal step that utilizes the task relationship.  Unlike in the previous work, we remove an example from the support set S by considering both the similarity between the examples (via confidence of the models) and the relationship between the tasks with less runtime per removal step. The proposed method empirically outperforms (both in terms of AUC and Time taken) other multitask budgeted learning schemes.\n\n3) two-stage budgeted approach for lifelong learning\nTo the best of our knowledge, our paper proposed the first practical budgeted scheme for lifelong multitask learning. The two-stage budgeted scheme allows us to use expensive budgeted schemes with best retention policy such as Projectron on task-specific budget T_k instead of S. \n\nWe will clarify these points along with additional details on update equations and budgeted removal step.\n\n“Smaller datasets”\nAll the datasets in our experiments are widely accepted benchmarks in online multi-task and lifelong learning evaluations (See Pentina 2016, Murugesan 2016).  We chose these 3 datasets for two main reasons: 1) for a fair comparison with the current online multi-task learning methods such as OSMTL, OMTRL, etc. 2) to consider different type of tasks that one may encounter in many practical applications such as spam detection, sentiment analysis, etc. \n\nWe plan to include additional experiments on datasets with large number of tasks in the revised version.\n\n“Hyper-parameters”\nWe tuned all the hyper-parameters via 5-fold cross validation. We will include additional details on the hyper-parameters of the baselines for clarity.\n\n“Theoretical analysis”\nWe are currently working on the theoretical bounds for the proposed lifelong learning approach. We will derive the generalization bounds for lifelong learning setting with respect to some unknown task-generating probability distribution.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Lifelong Learning with Output Kernels","abstract":"Lifelong learning poses considerable challenges in terms of effectiveness (minimizing prediction errors for all tasks) and overall computational tractability for real-time performance.

Most existing online multitask learning algorithms utilize this additional knowledge for learning the task relationship such as FOML, OMTRL, OSMTL, etc.\n\n“References for budgeted schemes”\nThank you for the additional references. The budget schemes from Hu et al. use the similarity between the examples for removal, on the other hand, our proposed budget schemes consider both the similarity between the examples and the relationship between the tasks to identify an example to remove.  The sparsification procedure considered in Engel et al.  will suffer from scalability issues similar to the Multitask Projectron as discussed in the paper.\n\n\\phi(.) is the feature function used in kernel learning.

It receives instances in an online setting, where both the prediction model and the relationship between the tasks are learnt using a online kernel based approach. It also proposed to use budgeting techniques to overcome computational costs. In general, the paper is poorly written, with many notation mistakes and inconsistencies. The idea does not seem to be novel, technical novelty is low, and the execution in experiments does not seem to be reliable. \n\nQuality: No obvious mistakes in the proposed method, but has very low novelty (as most methods follows existing studies in especially for online kernel learning). Many mistakes in the presentation and experiments.  \n\nOriginality: The ideas do not seem to be novel, and are mostly (trivially) using existing work as different components of the proposed technique. \n\nClarity: The paper makes many mistakes, and is difficult to read. [N] is elsewhere denoted as \\mathbb{N}. The main equation of Algorithm 2 merges into Algorithm 3. Many claims are made without justification (e.g. 2.2. “Cavallanti 2012 is not suitable for lifelong learning”… why?; “simple removal scheme … highest confidence” – what is the meaning of highest confidence?), etc. The removal strategy is not at all well explained – the objective function details and solving it are not discussed. \n\nSignificance: There is no theoretical guarantee on the performance, despite the author’s claiming this as a goal in the introduction itself (“goal of lifelong learner … computation”). The experiments are not reliable. Perceptron obtains a better performance than PA algorithms – which is very odd. Moreover, many of the multi-task baselines obtain a worse performance than a simple perceptron (which does not account for multi-task relationships). \n","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Lifelong Learning with Output Kernels","abstract":"Lifelong learning poses considerable challenges in terms of effectiveness (minimizing prediction errors for all tasks) and overall computational tractability for real-time performance.

The mapping function $phi$ appears in Eq. (1) without definition.\n2. The last equation in pp. 3 defines the decision function f by an inner product. In the equation, the notation x_t and i_t is not clearly defined.  More seriously, a comma is missed in the definition of the inner product.\n3. Some equations are labeled but never referenced, e.g., Eq. (4).\n4. The physical meaning of Eq.(7) is unclear.  However, this equation is the key proposal of the paper.   For example, what is the output of the Eq. (7)? What is the main objective of Eq. (7)?  Moreover, what support vectors should be removed by optimizing Eq. (7)?  One main issue is that the notation $phi$ is not clearly defined.   The computation of f-y_r\\phi(s_r) makes it hard to understand.  Especially,  the dimension of $phi$ in Eq.(7) is unknown. \n\nABOUT EXPERIMENTS\n1.\tIt is unclear how to tune the hyperparameters.\n2.\tIn Table 1, the results only report the standard deviation of AUC.
