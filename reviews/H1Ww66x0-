It receives instances in an online setting, where both the prediction model and the relationship between the tasks are learnt using a online kernel based approach. It also proposed to use budgeting techniques to overcome computational costs. In general, the paper is poorly written, with many notation mistakes and inconsistencies. The idea does not seem to be novel, technical novelty is low, and the execution in experiments does not seem to be reliable. \n\nQuality: No obvious mistakes in the proposed method, but has very low novelty (as most methods follows existing studies in especially for online kernel learning). Many mistakes in the presentation and experiments.  \n\nOriginality: The ideas do not seem to be novel, and are mostly (trivially) using existing work as different components of the proposed technique. \n\nClarity: The paper makes many mistakes, and is difficult to read. [N] is elsewhere denoted as \\mathbb{N}. The main equation of Algorithm 2 merges into Algorithm 3. Many claims are made without justification (e.g. 2.2. “Cavallanti 2012 is not suitable for lifelong learning”… why?; “simple removal scheme … highest confidence” – what is the meaning of highest confidence?), etc. The removal strategy is not at all well explained – the objective function details and solving it are not discussed. \n\nSignificance: There is no theoretical guarantee on the performance, despite the author’s claiming this as a goal in the introduction itself (“goal of lifelong learner … computation”). The experiments are not reliable. Perceptron obtains a better performance than PA algorithms – which is very odd. Moreover, many of the multi-task baselines obtain a worse performance than a simple perceptron (which does not account for multi-task relationships). \n","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Lifelong Learning with Output Kernels","abstract":"Lifelong learning poses considerable challenges in terms of effectiveness (minimizing prediction errors for all tasks) and overall computational tractability for real-time performance.

","rating":"3: Clear rejection","review":"CONTRIBUTION\nThe main contribution of the paper is not clearly stated.  To the reviewer, It seems “life-long learning” is the same as “online learning”.  However, the whole paper does not define what “life-long learning” is.\nThe limited budget scheme is well established in the literature. \n1. J. Hu, H. Yang, I. King, M. R. Lyu, and A. M.-C. So.

Many meanings of the equations are not stated clearly, e.g., $phi$ in eq. (7). Furthermore, the equation in algorithm 2 is not well formatted. \n\nDETAILED COMMENTS\n1. The mapping function $phi$ appears in Eq. (1) without definition.\n2. The last equation in pp. 3 defines the decision function f by an inner product. In the equation, the notation x_t and i_t is not clearly defined.  More seriously, a comma is missed in the definition of the inner product.\n3. Some equations are labeled but never referenced, e.g., Eq. (4).\n4. The physical meaning of Eq.(7) is unclear.  However, this equation is the key proposal of the paper.   For example, what is the output of the Eq. (7)? What is the main objective of Eq. (7)?  Moreover, what support vectors should be removed by optimizing Eq. (7)?  One main issue is that the notation $phi$ is not clearly defined.   The computation of f-y_r\\phi(s_r) makes it hard to understand.  Especially,  the dimension of $phi$ in Eq.(7) is unknown. \n\nABOUT EXPERIMENTS\n1.\tIt is unclear how to tune the hyperparameters.\n2.\tIn Table 1, the results only report the standard deviation of AUC. No standard deviations of nSV and Time are reported.\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Lifelong Learning with Output Kernels","abstract":"Lifelong learning poses considerable challenges in terms of effectiveness (minimizing prediction errors for all tasks) and overall computational tractability for real-time performance.
