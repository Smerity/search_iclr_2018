One key part of Transformer is self-attention in the decoder: an attention layer that allows the decoder to attend to previously generated (decoded) words. This is a main innovation of the Transformer architecture and it is missing from SliceNet (as we started working on SliceNet before the Transformer paper). We only have the encoder-decoder attention known from previous sequence-to-sequence models (i.e., the decoder can attend to the encoder, but not to previously decoded words). We believe that this difference is responsible for the difference in results: as far as we know, no architecture without self-attention in the decoder has shown better results than SliceNet. It should also be possible to combine the decoder self-attention with SliceNet -- some results (with non-separable convolutions) are already coming up as SNAIL for image generation (https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09763). We believe that the techniques we present in this paper can be used to extend SNAIL to get additional improvements, and it should also work for tasks like image generation, parsing, summarization and others."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Depthwise Separable Convolutions for Neural Machine Translation","abstract":"Depthwise separable convolutions reduce the number of parameters and computation used in convolutional operations while increasing representational efficiency.\nThey have been shown to be successful in image classification models, both in obtaining better models than previously possible for a given parameter count (the Xception architecture) and considerably reducing the number of parameters required to perform at a given level (the MobileNets family of architectures).

For instance, it seems that the separable convolution presented in Section 2.1 were introduced by (Chollet, 2016) and are not part of the contribution of this paper. The authors should thus clarify the contributions of the paper.\n\nIn terms of significance, the SliceNet architecture is interesting and is a solid contribution for reducing computation cost of sequence-to-sequence models. The experiments on NMT are convincing and gives interesting insights, although I would like to see some pointers about why in Table 3 the Transformer approach (Vaswani et al. 2017) outperforms SliceNet.\n\nI wonder if the proposed approach could be applied to other sequence-to-sequence tasks in NLP or even in speech recognition ? \n\nMinor comment: \n* The equations are not easy to follow, they should be numbered.

The authors also introduce a new \"super-separable\" convolution layer, which further reduces the computational cost of depthwise separable convolutions. Results are presented on the WMT English to German translation task, where the method is shown to perform second-best behind the Transformer model.\n\nThe paper's greatest strength is in my opinion the quality of its exposition of the proposed method. The relationship between spatial convolutions, pointwise convolutions, depthwise convolutions, depthwise separable convolutions, grouped convolutions, and super-separable convolutions is explained very clearly, and the authors properly introduce each model component.\n\nPerhaps as a consequence of this, the experimental section feels squeezed in comparison. Quantitative results are presented in two fairly dense tables (especially Table 2) which, although parsable after reading the paper carefully, could benefit from a little bit more information on how they should be read. The conclusions that are drawn in the text are stated without citing metrics or architectural configurations, leaving it up to the reader to connect the conclusions to the table contents.\n\nOverall, I feel that the results presented make a compelling case both for the effectiveness of depthwise separable convolutions and larger convolution windows, as well as the overall performance achievable by such an architecture.
