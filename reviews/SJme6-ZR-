Following your feedback, we have moved it to a section in the paper called ‘Formal Framework’.\n\n2.\t(Frailty analysis) In our original draft, we followed prior work [Witten and Tibshirani, 2010; Gaynor and Bair, 2013] and refrained from comparing our approach with frailty models to avoid confusion w.r.t. the task at hand. But we now do see the benefit of clarifying the tasks, and thank the reviewer for asking us to do so. We added the following paragraph clarifying this difference. \n\n“Extensive research has been done on what is known as frailty analysis, for predicting survival outcomes in the presence of clustered observations. Although frailty models provide more flexibility in the presence of clustered observations, they do not provide a mechanism for obtaining the clusters themselves, which is our primary goal. In addition, our approach does not assume proportional hazards unlike most frailty models.” \n\n3.\tCensoring and ‘end-of-life’ are simply the two possibilities for each user. In the case where we have end-of-life signals, a subject could be “dead” or “censored” based on the signal. Similarly, when we do not have an end-of-life signal, there is a probability of the subject being “dead” or “censored” (in our case, we calculate this probability using S_u, the time till censoring).\n\n4.\tWe have reported the results for different choices for the loss function - Kuiper loss vs Kolmogorov-Smirnov loss. Although, the difference in performance between the two loss functions is not significant in the Friendster dataset, Kuiper loss is theoretically better due to its increased statistical power in distinguishing distribution tails. \n \n5.\tWe have also reported results for different neural network design choices (batch sizes, learning rates, number of hidden layers, and number of hidden units) in Appendix.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"A Deep Learning Approach for Survival Clustering without End-of-life Signals","abstract":"The goal of survival clustering is to map subjects (e.g., users in a social network, patients in a medical study) to $K$ clusters ranging from low-risk to high-risk.

I do not feel experienced enough in the field to evaluate the significance of this work.\n\nThe approach proposed in the manuscript is mainly based on a newly-designed nonparametric loss function using the Kuiper statistic and uses a feed-forward neural network to optimize the loss function. This approach does challenge some traditional assumptions, such as the presence of end-of-life signals or the artificial defined timeouts. Instead of giving a clear end-of-life signal, the authors specify a probability of end-of-life that permits us to take into account the associated uncertainty. By analyzing a large-scale social network dataset, it is shown that the proposed method performs better on average than the other two traditional models.\n\nCons:       \nI think that the main drawback of the paper is that the structure of the neural network and the deep learning techniques used for optimizing the loss function are not explained in sufficient detail.
