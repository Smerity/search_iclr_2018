Unfortunately this seems to be attributable to a lack of clarity in the paper and we'd like to emphasize that we didn't try to provide an alternative to methods which have been specifically designed for that problem. We evaluated our methods on linear ICA and PNL ICA because solutions to these problems are known and comparisons were possible but the point is that the method we propose is less dependent on the specific mixing process.\n\n\"1)The ICA problem can be formulated as the minimization of pairwise mutual information [1] or one-dimensional entropy [2]. In other words, estimating the joint dependence of the source coordinates is not necessary; it is worthwhile to avoid it.\"\n\nThe first observation is specific to the linear case but interesting to know about. Working with the entropy seems to be based on the same ideas as infomax and introduces other limitations but we consider it complementary to our approach. \n\n\"2)The PNL ICA task can be efficiently tackled by first 'removing' the nonlinearity followed by classical linear ICA; see for example [3].\"\n\nWhile we didn't aim to be optimal for the PNL case either, we'd like to point out that the approach in [3] is still an iterative procedure.\n\n\"4)Optimizing non-differentiable IT measures can computationally quite efficiently carried out in the ICA context by e.g., Givens rotations [7]; differentiable ICA cost functions can be robustly handled by Stiefel manifold methods; see for example [8,9].\"\n\nThese points seem to be specific to the linear case again but are once again interesting.\n\n\"5)Section 3.1: This section is devoted to generating samples from the product of the marginals, even using separate generator networks. I do not see the necessity of these solutions; the subtask can be solved by independently shuffling all the coordinates of the sample.\"\n\nThe first solution is indeed basically shuffling the coordinates of the sample but we admit that the text was a bit overly didactic and we shortened it a bit. The separate generator networks could be interesting in a setup in which shuffling is not desirable because there are temporal dependencies, for example. We changed the text to make this more clear.\n\n\"6)Experiments (Section 6): \ni) It seems to me that the proposed NN-based technique has some quite serious divergence issues: 'After discarding diverged models, ...' or 'Unfortunately, the model selection procedure also didn't identify good settings for the Anica-g model...'.\nii) The proposed method gives pretty comparable results to the chosen baselines (fastICA, PNLMISEP) on the selected small-dimensional tasks. In fact, [7,8,9] are likely to provide more accurate (fastICA is a simple kurtosis based method, which is a somewhat crude 'estimate' of entropy) and faster estimates; see also 2).\"\n\nThe first point is fair in that our model selection heuristic wasn't always able to identify the best model and that GAN training can be unstable. That said, the discarding of models was mainly because we performed a random search with aggressive hyperparameter ranges which could select very high learning rates, for example. The second point is fair too in that the cited methods might prove to be stronger baselines. We don't think that obtaining comparable results with a more general method is a bad thing but that is of course somewhat subjective.\n\nWe'd finally like to point out that we don't propose the use of the Wasserstein GAN loss specifically but GAN type objectives in general for learning independent features. The WGAN example in the text was mainly there to illustrate how in some cases the objective can be seen as a proxy for the mutual information.\n\nThanks again."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Learning Independent Features with Adversarial Nets for Non-linear ICA","abstract":"Reliable measures of statistical dependence could potentially be useful tools for learning independent features and performing tasks like source separation using Independent Component Analysis (ICA).

However, we respectfully disagree that we should drop the treatment of these problems because we still think it is interesting that they can be solved with a new approach which in our opinion is very different from previous methods. This was not obvious to us when we started our research. \n\nA better definition of the version of the non-linear problem would indeed have been desirable in the context of source separation. While we presented the overcomplete case as a first step for evaluating the method, we surely realize that it doesn't come with any theoretical guarantees and that the obtained correlation scores are limited in interpretability. We adjusted the text to make this more clear. \n\nThe alternative to use estimates of the mutual information is certainly something we considered for both evaluation and model selection but this proved to be difficult in general. We tried both Kraskov's nearest-neighbor estimator and the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion but both these estimators typically seemed to consider the features fully independent during most stages of training and don't take into account how informative they are about the input. We still like to thank the reviewer for motivating us to pursue this direction further and like to hear more in detail what is meant with the \"quality of the low-dimensional data manifold\". If there is some principled way of measuring the latter we would certainly like to investigate it.\n\nThanks.\n\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Learning Independent Features with Adversarial Nets for Non-linear ICA","abstract":"Reliable measures of statistical dependence could potentially be useful tools for learning independent features and performing tasks like source separation using Independent Component Analysis (ICA).

As you suggested, we made the definitions of the full system in Section 4 a bit more explicit. \n\n\"The overcomplete audio source separation case is well known for audio and I could not understand why a convincing baseline can not be found. Is this due to nonlinear mixing?\"\n\nGood question and something we certainly looked at. The most important reason for our lack of a baseline here is that the real-world audio separation setting is slightly more complicated due to the different arrival times of the source signals and reverberation. Most multi-channel audio separation methods we know of work in the frequency domain to alleviate some of these issues, introducing the necessity to predict phase information to reconstruct the raw signals. Another issue was that the evaluation criteria and benchmark data sets in this domain still seem to be under active development but of course we'd love to hear about good real-world benchmarks we might have overlooked. \n\n\"As 26 channels and 6 channels are given, a simple regularization based method can be easily developed to provide a baseline performance, \"\n\nThis sounds interesting. Do you mean an auto-encoder with more standard regularization? In that case the hidden units wouldn't be trained to become independent but perhaps we misunderstood the suggestion.\n\n\"The need for normalization in section 4 is surprising, as it obviously renders the outputs dependent.\"\n\nWe normalize over samples in a batch and not over the units in the layer but admit that this was not clear in the paper.

As the input/output densities are often not known and/or are intractable, natural independence measures such as mutual information are hard to estimate. In practice, the independence is characterized by certain functions of higher order moments -- leading to several alternatives in a zoo of independence objectives.  \n\nThe current paper makes the iteresting observation that independent features can also be computed via adversarial objectives. The key idea of adversarial training is adapted in this context as comparing samples from the joint distribution and the product of the marginals. \n\nTwo methods are proposed for drawing samples from the products of marginals. \nOne method is generating samples but permuting randomly the sample indices for individual marginals - this resampling mechanism generates approximately independent samples from the product distribution.

The method seems interesting, but the presentation has a severe lack of focus.\n\nFirst, the authors should focus their discussion instead of trying to address a broad range of ICA problems from linear to post-nonlinear (PNL) to nonlinear. I would highly recommend the authors to study the review \"Advances in Nonlinear Blind Source Separation\" by Jutten and Karhunen (2003/2004) to understand the problems they are trying to solve.\n\nLinear ICA is a solved problem and the authors do not seem to be able to add anything there, so I would recommend dropping that to save space for the more interesting material.\n\nPNL ICA is solvable and there are a number of algorithms proposed for it, some cited already in the above review, but also more recent ones. From this perspective, the presented comparison seems quite inadequate.\n\nFully general nonlinear ICA is ill-posed, as shown already by Darmois (1953, doi:10.2307/1401511). Given this, the authors should indicate more clearly what is their method expected to do. There are an infinite number of nonlinear ICA solutions - which one is the proposed method going to return and why is that relevant? There are fewer relevant comparisons here, but at least Lappalainen and Honkela (2000) seem to target the same problem as the proposed method.\n\nThe use of 6 dimensional example in the experiments is a very good start, as higher dimensions are quite different and much more interesting than very commonly used 2D examples.\n\nOne idea for evaluation: comparison with ground truth makes sense for PNL, but not so much for general nonlinear because of unidentifiability. For general nonlinear ICA you could consider evaluating the quality of the estimated low-dimensional data manifold or evaluating the mutual information of separated sources on new test data.\n\nUpdate after author feedback: thanks for the response and the revision.

Unfortunately, many of such measures, like the mutual information, are hard to estimate and optimize directly.  We propose to learn independent features with adversarial objectives (Goodfellow et al. 2014, Arjovsky et al. 2017) which optimize such measures implicitly.  These objectives compare samples from the joint distribution and the product of the marginals without the need to compute any probability densities. We also propose two methods for obtaining samples from the product of the marginals using either a simple resampling trick or a separate parametric distribution.
