The main goal of Graph2Seq is to provide a representation framework for learning tasks (e.g., classification, optimization), over graphs that are not fixed. \n\nSupposing we have a candidate neural network framework (such as Graph2Seq) that can take in arbitrary sized graphs as input, and produce an output. Knowing whether such a framework could work well on graphs of any size is unfortunately a difficult question to answer. In this context, we have included Theorem 1 as a strong conceptual evidence towards the scalability of Graph2Seq. The fact that the entire graph topology can be recovered from the Graph2Seq representation (even if we ignore sample complexity and computation issues) suggests the time-series has enough information to recover the graph in principle. \n\nIndeed, there are many ways in which one could represent a graph as a sequence (with potentially shorter sequences). However, the issue with methods involving the adjacency matrix is they require a prior labelling of the graph nodes (to identify the individual rows and columns of the matrix), and it is not clear how to incorporate such labels into the neural network. This is perhaps why the adjacency matrix is itself not used as a representation in the first place, and methods like GCNN are necessary. What we are seeking is a label-free representation.

Please find our response to the issues raised below. \n\nOn motivation: \n\nWe are rather puzzled by the comment that the motivations are unclear. Using neural networks for graph structured data is a fast-emerging field and is of topical interest (massive attendance in a recent NIPS workshop on Non-Euclidean deep learning https://nips.cc/Conferences/2017/Schedule?showEvent=8735 serves to illustrate). Our paper directly addresses one of the key open problems in the area: how to design neural networks for graphs that can scale to graph inputs of arbitrary sizes and shapes. \n\nSuch a scalable solution may be required for a variety of reasons: (1) directly training on large instances may not be possible; (2) application specific training can be avoided, and trained algorithms can be used in variety of settings; or (3) a scalable algorithm may be easier to analyze, reason about and can potentially inspire advances in theory CS. Indeed, traditionally algorithms in CS have usually been of this flavor. However, to our best awareness, such an analog in deep learning for graphs has been critically missing. \n\nThe combinatorial optimization problems we have used in our evaluations (vertex cover, max cut, max independent set) are also interesting and many recent works (e.g. Bello et al ’17, Vinyals et al ’15, Dai et al ‘17) have considered these problems. Moreover, input instances in these problems capture the very essence of what makes representing signals over non-fixed graphs challenging: (i) the input graphs could have arbitrary topology, and (ii) the input graphs could have arbitrary size. The simplicity of these problems (in terms of vertex/edge features) allow us to focus on directly addressing these two scalability issues without worrying about dependencies arising from high-dimensional node/edge attributes. \n\nOn evaluations:\n\nWe have evaluated graphs of size up to 3200 and will include in our revision. Our test graphs are not sparse, and contain a large number of edges: e.g., a 3200 node Erdos-Renyi graph has 700,000 edges; a 3200 node random bipartite graph has 1.9 million edges. These graph sizes are consistent and well-above the sizes used in the neural networks combinatorial optimization literature (e.g., Learning combinatorial optimization algorithms over graphs, Dai et al, NIPS ’17 (up to 1200 nodes); Neural combinatorial optimization with reinforcement learning, Bello et al, ’17 (100 nodes); Pointer networks, Vinyals et al, NIPS ’15 (50 nodes)). Compared to the recent NIPS spotlight paper by Dai et al (which focuses on similar combinatorial problems), our results illustrate significant generalizations both in graph topology, and graph size.\n\nThe space of problems where the graph instances are not fixed is vast, and finding scalable learning representations for these applications remains a grand challenge. To our knowledge, this is also a longer-term project and a one-size-fits-all approach that solves all of those applications may not be possible. In this regard, our work presents an important first-step of recognizing, formalizing and understanding the key challenges involved, and also proposes a promising solution that directly addresses the key issues. \n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Graph2Seq: Scalable Learning Dynamics for Graphs","abstract":"Neural networks are increasingly used as a general purpose approach to learning algorithms over graph structured data.

They also define a formal computational model, called LOCAL-Gather that includes GRAPH2SEQ and other classes of GCNN representations, and show that GRAPH2SEQ is capable of computing certain graph functions that fixed-depth GCNNs cannot. They experiment on graphs of size at most 800 nodes to discover minimum vertex cover and show that their method perform much better than GCNNs but is comparable with greedy heuristics for minimum vertex cover.\n\nI find the experiments to be hugely disappointing. Claiming that this particular representation helps in scalability and then doing experiment on graphs of extremely small size does not reflect well. It would have been much more desirable if the authors had conducted experiments on large graphs and compare the results with greedy heuristics.

Also sample complexity may be exponential in graph degree.","rating":"4: Ok but not good enough - rejection","review":"This paper proposes a novel way of embedding graph structure into a sequence that can have an unbounded length. \n\nThere has been a significant amount of prior work (e.g. d graph convolutional neural networks) for signals supported on a specific graph. This paper on the contrary tries to encode the topology of a graph using a dynamical system created by the graph and randomization. \n\nThe main theorem is that the created dynamical system can be used to reverse engineer the graph topology for any digraph. \nAs far as I understood, the authors are doing essentially reverse directed graphical model learning. In classical learning of directed graphical models (or causal DAGs) one wants to learn the structure of a graph from observed data created by this graph inducing conditional independencies on data. This procedure is creating a dynamical system that (following very closely previous work) estimates conditional directed information for every pair of vertices u,v and can find if an edge is present from the observed trajectory. \nThe recovery algorithm is essentially previous work (but the application to graph recovery is new).\n\nThe authors state:\n``Estimating conditional directed information efficiently from samples is itself an active area of research Quinn et al. (2011), but simple plug-in estimators with a standard kernel density estimator will be consistent.''\n\nOne thing that is missing here is that the number of samples needed could be exponential in the degrees of the graph. Therefore, it is not clear at all that high-dimensional densities or directed information can be estimated from a number of samples that is polynomial in the dimension (e.g. graph degree).\n\nThis is related to the second limitation, that there is no sample complexity bounds presented only an asymptotic statement. \n\nOne remark is that there are many ways to represent a finite graph with a sequence that can be decoded back to the graph (and of course if there is no bound on the graph size, there will be no bound on the size of the sequence). For example, one could take the adjacency matrix and sequentially write down one row after the other (perhaps using a special symbol to indicate 'next row'). Many other simple methods can be obtained also, with a size of sequence being polynomial (in fact linear) in the size of the graph. I understand that such trivial representations might not work well with RNNs but they would satisfy stronger versions of Theorem 1 with optimal size. \nOn the contrary it was not clear how the proposed sequence will scale in the graph size. \n\n\nAnother remark is that it seems that GCNN and this paper solve different problems. \nGCNNs want to represent graph-supported signals (on a fixed graph) while this paper tries to represent the topology of a graph, which seems different. \n\n\nThe experimental evaluation was somewhat limited and that is the biggest problem from a practical standpoint. It is not clear why one would want to use these sequences for solving MVC. There are several graph classification tasks that try to use the graph structure (as well as possibly other features) see eg the bioinformatics \nand other applications. Literature includes for example:\nGraph Kernels by S.V.N. Vishwanathan et al. \nDeep graph kernels (Yanardag & Vishwanathan and graph invariant kernels (Orsini et al.),\nwhich use counts of small substructures as features. \n\nThe are many benchmarks of graph classification tasks where the proposed representation could be useful but significantly more validation work would be needed to make that case. \n\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Graph2Seq: Scalable Learning Dynamics for Graphs","abstract":"Neural networks are increasingly used as a general purpose approach to learning algorithms over graph structured data.
