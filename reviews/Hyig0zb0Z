However, ASG uses a discriminative model P(label|sound) = P(Y|X) instead of P(X|Y) in MMI. This goes out of the scope of this paper, though.\n\nI hope you are just misremembering. MMI is maximizing P(Y|X). See [1, 2]. MMI is a general loss function, and need not be tied to lattices and HMMs. The only minor difference between MMI and ASG is whether the segmentations are marginalized. Sometimes people marginalize segmentations when using MMI, e.g., in [2]. In this case, MMI and ASG are equivalent.\n\n> It's quadratic in the # of characters in the dictionary, linear in sequence length. CTC is linear in both (dict size/sentence length): it is faster for languages with a large # of characters (Chinese).

CTC can be applied to label sets beyond characters [3, 4], so the dependency on the size of the label set matters.\n\n> This is the first paper to show that letter-based systems can reach phone/senone-based systems performance, on a standard dataset, with no additional data.\n\n> All systems are trained on LibriSpeech and without limitations, our comparison is as meaningful as it gets.\n\nI agree with this statement and I agree the authors have detailed the how, but the more important question is why. Is it because of ASG? Is it because of switching from plain CNNs to gated CNNs? Or is it just because of better tuning? Building a system with known techniques and better tuning should not be considered as a contribution. This is also why I said the comparison in table 4 is meaningless. The authors should at least conduct experiments to show where the improvements are coming from. Please at least compare against CTC, and at least compare plain CNNs against gated CNNs. It would be even better if the authors can use the same network architectures as the other papers appeared in table 4 to compare CTC and ASG.

We will clarify that letter-based systems (also called grapheme-based systems) predate all the recommended citations (see \"Context-dependent acoustic modeling using graphemes for large vocabulary speech recognition\", 2002 or \"Grapheme based speech recognition\", 2003). However, previous letter-based work report WER far behind from phone-based systems.\n\nConcerning recommended citations: TIMIT ones are not very relevant, as they report phone error rate (no WER). TIMIT is also a tiny dataset. WSJ-related citations are far from reaching SOTA â€” and WSJ is an order of magnitude smaller than LibriSpeech.

It is fair to say that this paper contains almost no novelty.\n\nThis paper starts by bashing the complexity of conventional HMM systems, and states the benefits of their approach. However, all of the other grapheme-based end-to-end systems enjoy the same benefit as CTC and ASG. Prior work along this line includes [3, 4, 5, 6, 7].\n\nUsing MFSC, or more commonly known as log mel filter bank outputs, has been pretty common since [8]. Having a separate subsection (2.1) discussing this seems unnecessary.\n\nArguments in section 2.3 are weak because, again, all other grapheme-based end-to-end systems have the same benefit as CTC and ASG. It is unclear why discriminative training, such as MMI, sMBR, and lattice-free MMI, is mentioned in section 2.3. Discriminative training is not invented to overcome the lack of manual segmentations, and is equally applicable to the case where we have manual segmentations.\n\nThe authors argue that ASG is better than CTC in section 2.3.1 because it does not use the blank symbol and can be faster during decoding. However, once the transition scores are introduced in ASG, the search space becomes quadratic in the number of characters, while CTC is still linear in the number characters. In addition, ASG requires additional forward-backward computation for computing the partition function (second term in eq 3). There is no reason to believe that ASG can be faster than CTC in both training and decoding.\n\nThe connection between ASG, CTC, and marginal log loss has been addressed in [9], and it does make sense to train ASG with the partition function. Otherwise, the objective won't be a proper probability distribution.\n\nThe citation style in section 2.4 seems off. Also see [4] for a great description of how beam search is done in CTC.\n\nDetails about training, such as the optimizer, step size, and batch size, are missing. Does no batching (in section 3.2) means a batch size of one utterance?\n\nIn the last paragraph of section 3.2, why is there a huge difference in real-time factors between the clean and other set? Something is wrong unless the authors are using different beam widths in the two settings.\n\nThe paper can be significantly improved if the authors compare the performance and decoding speed against CTC with the same gated convnet. It would be even better to compare CTC and ASG to seq2seq-based models with the same gated convnet. Similar experiments should be conducted on switchboard and wsj because librespeech is several times larger than switchboard and wsj. None of the comparison in table 4 is really meaningful, because none of the other systems have parameters as many as 19 layers of convolution. Why does CTC fail when trained without the blanks? Is there a way to fix it besides using ASG? It is also unclear why speaker-adaptive training is not needed. At which layer do the features become speaker invariant? Can the system improve further if speaker-adaptive features are used instead of log mels? This paper would be much stronger if the authors can include these experiments and analyses.\n\n[1] R Collobert, C Puhrsch, G Synnaeve, Wav2letter: an end-to-end convnet-based speech recognition system, 2016\n\n[2] Y Dauphin, A Fan, M Auli, D Grangier, Language modeling with gated convolutional nets, 2017\n\n[3] A Graves and N Jaitly, Towards End-to-End Speech Recognition with Recurrent Neural Networks, 2014\n\n[4] A Maas, Z Xie, D Jurafsky, A Ng, Lexicon-Free Conversational Speech Recognition with Neural Networks, 2015\n\n[5] Y Miao, M Gowayyed, F Metze, EESEN: End-to-end speech recognition using deep RNN models and WFST-based decoding, 2015\n\n[6] D Bahdanau, J Chorowski, D Serdyuk, P Brakel, Y Bengio, End-to-end attention-based large vocabulary speech recognition, 2016\n\n[7] W Chan, N Jaitly, Q Le, O Vinyals, Listen, attend and spell, 2015\n\n[8] A Graves, A Mohamed, G Hinton, Speech recognition with deep recurrent neural networks, 2013\n\n[9] H Tang, L Lu, L Kong, K Gimpel, K Livescu, C Dyer, N Smith, S Renals, End-to-End Neural Segmental Models for Speech Recognition, 2017","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Gated ConvNets for Letter-Based ASR","abstract":"In this paper we introduce a new speech recognition system, leveraging a simple letter-based ConvNet acoustic model.
