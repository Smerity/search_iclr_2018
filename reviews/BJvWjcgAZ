The basic principle is to update Q values starting from the end of the episode in order to facility quick propagation of rewards back along the episode.\n\nThe paper is interesting, but it lacks the proper comparisons to previously published techniques.\n\nThe results presented by this paper shows improvement over the baseline. But the Atari results is still significantly worse than the current SOTA.\n\nIn the non-tabular case, the authors have actually moved away from Q learning and defined an objective that is both on and off-policy. Some (theoretical) analysis would be nice. It is hard to judge whether the objective defined in the non-tabular defines a contraction operator at all in the tabular case.\n\nThere has been a number of highly relevant papers. Prioritized replay, for example, could have a very similar effect to proposed approach in the tabular case.\n\nIn the non-tabular case, the Retrace algorithm, tree backup, Watkin's Q learning all bear significant resemblance to the proposed method. Although the proposed algorithm is different from all 3, the authors should still have compared to at least one of them as a baseline. The Retrace algorithm specifically has also been shown to help significantly in the Atari case, and it defines a convergent update rule.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Sample-Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning via Episodic Backward Update","abstract":"We propose Episodic Backward Update - a new algorithm to boost the performance of a deep reinforcement learning agent by fast reward propagation.

The algorithm selects transitions in a backward order fashion from end of episode to be more effective in propagating learning of new rewards. This issue of fast propagation of updates is a common theme in RL (cf eligibility traces, prioritised sweeping, and more recently DQN with prioritised replay etc.). Here the proposed update applies the max Bellman operator recursively on a trajectory (unsure whether this is novel), with some decay to prevent accumulating errors with the nested max.\n\nThe paper is written in a clear way. The proposed approach seems reasonable, but I would have guessed that prioritized replay would also naturally sample transitions in roughly that order - given that TD-errors would at first be higher towards the end of an episode and progress backwards from there. I think this should have been one of the baselines to compare to for that reason.\n\nThe experimental results seem promising in the illustrative MNIST domain. Atari results seem decent, especially given that experiments are limited to 10M frames, though the advantage compared to the related approach of optimality tightening is not obvious. \n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Sample-Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning via Episodic Backward Update","abstract":"We propose Episodic Backward Update - a new algorithm to boost the performance of a deep reinforcement learning agent by fast reward propagation.

The targets’ update rule is similar to a regular tabular Q-learning update with high learning rate beta: this allows faster propagation of rewards obtained at the end of the episode (while beta=0 corresponds to regular DQN with no such reward propagation). This mechanism is shown to improve on Q-learning in a toy 2D maze environment (with MNIST-based pixel states providing cell coordinates) with beta=1, and on DQN and its optimality tightening variant on Atari games with beta=0.5.\n\nThe intuition behind the algorithm (that one should try to speed up the propagation of rewards across multiple steps) is not new, in fact it has inspired other approaches like n-step Q-learning, eligibility traces or more recently Retrace(lambda) in deep RL. Actually the idea of replaying experiences in backward order can be traced back to the origins of experience replay («  Programming Robots Using Reinforcement Learning and Teaching », Lin, 1991), something that is not mentioned here. That being said, to the best of my knowledge the specific algorithm proposed in this submission (Alg. 2) is novel, even if Alg. 1 is not (Alg. 1 can be seen as a specific instance of Lin’s algorithm with a very high learning rate, and clearly only makes sense in toy deterministic environments).\n\nIn the absence of any theoretical analysis of the proposed approach, I would have expected an in-depth empirical validation. Unfortunately this is not the case here. In the toy environment (4.1) I am surprised by the really poor quality of the results (paths 5-10 times longer than the shortest path on average): have algorithms been run for a long enough time? Or maybe the average is a bad performance measure due to outliers? I would have also appreciated a comparison to Retrace(lambda), which is a more principled way to use multi-step rewards than n-step Q-learning (which is technically an on-policy method). Similar remarks can be made on the Atari experiments (4.2), where 10M frames is really low (the original DQN paper had results on 50M frames, and Rainbow reports 200M frames in only ~2x the training time reported here). The comparison also should have included prioritized experience replay, which has been shown to provide a significant boost in DQN, but may be tricky to combine with the proposed algorithm. Overall comparing only to vanilla DQN and its optimality tightening variant is too limited when there have been so many other meaningful improvements over DQN. This makes it really hard to tell whether the proposed algorithm would actually help when combined with a state-of-the-art method like Rainbow for instance.\n\nA few additional small remarks and questions:\n- « Second, there is no point in updating a one-step transition unless the future transitions have not been updated yet. »: should « unless » be replaced by « if »?\n- In 4.1 is there a maximum number of steps per episode and can you please confirm that training is done independently for each maze?\n- Typo in eq. 3: the - in the max should be a comma\n- There is a good amount of typos and grammar errors, though they do not harm the readability of the paper\n- Citations for « Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-learning » and « Dueling Network Architectures for Deep Reinforcement Learning » could refer to their conference versions\n- « epsilon starts from 1 and is annealed to 0 at 200,000 steps in a quadratic manner »: please specify the exact formula\n- Fig. 7 is really confusing, there seem to be typos and it is not clear why the beta updates appear in these specific cells, please revise it if you want to keep it","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Sample-Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning via Episodic Backward Update","abstract":"We propose Episodic Backward Update - a new algorithm to boost the performance of a deep reinforcement learning agent by fast reward propagation.
