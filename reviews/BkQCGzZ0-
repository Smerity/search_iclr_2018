We will move Figure 2 to the beginning and add a description of a sequence model. We only omitted it because we considered it standard for ICLR, but we will move it to the front. As for the function c(s), the diagram for it is in Figure 1. The diagram for the entire process is in Figure 2, but when we move it to the front we also plan to expand it to clarify the whole process.\n\nAs for using MOS, it has to our knowledge never been applied to translation and we know of no papers that would report MOS scores for WMT, so our results would be hard to compare. But even if we used a more standard metric, they all (including MOS) have the problem that they do not take the diversity into account at all. The advantage of our approach is that it can generate a diverse set of translations, but we don't know of any metric to quantify this (and we'd be grateful for pointers if one has been used before)."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Discrete Autoencoders for Sequence Models","abstract":"Recurrent models for sequences have been recently successful at many tasks, especially for language modeling\nand machine translation.

Putting that into a formal equation at the beginning of your paper makes reading immensely easier. This also enables you to introduce Figure 2 at the beginning rather than the end. Why would I want to see it at the end? \n\nYour treatment of auto encoding function c(s) is similar. Why not to give a block diagram to describe the process? Which parts are discrete, which parts are continuous. What would be the relation between dense(w), bottleneck(w) and c(s)? Show how does the training signal goes through these. What is the training objective function? It would have immensely helped to have a diagram of the entire process rather than drawing it myself after reading 2 pages of text. \n\nAs I mentioned in my previous review, a single example is not meaningful and you should use metrics such as mean opinion score (MOS) used in speech synthesis. Generate N samples, ask colleagues that speak German to assess how good they are without telling them from which model these samples came from, rank the results.

In the body of the paper, we try to give complete mathematical definitions of every term that appears there, the whole Section 2 is devoted to that, and Figures 1 and 2 are a diagramatic representation. We would like to improve them, but please give us concrete suggestions. We also double-checked the paper with external readers and it seemed to them that every single term was properly mathematically defined -- please clarify which terms are undefined to help us improve the paper. As for Section 3.4, we agree that it would be great to measure the diversity of translations in a quantitative way, not just qualitatively. But we are not aware of any metric of this kind -- we'd be happy to add the results if the reviewer can suggest one. Lack of such metric might be related to the fact that our work, to the best of our knowledge, presents the first time when an autoencoder works well enough for language to allow for such diverse results.

We've performed a number of experiments with VAEs in the same setting. The reviewer writes \"How is the performance if c(s) is replaced with the representations achieved from autoencoder, variational autoencoder or simply the sentence vectors [...]\". We wanted to assess this, but it is hard in principle to calculate DSAE in this case, as the number of bits in the auto-encoded representation cannot be easily measured in the dense case. In principle it's  not clear at all how to measure it for plain autoencoders or sentence vectors as even a 1-d real number can contain an unlimited number of bits (if it's a 32-bit float, it's just 32, but that's still more than our discrete representation). For VAEs, one can use the KL divergence as measure, but this is an approximate notion even in theory. In practice, all dense autoencoders, even into 4-d or 6-d vectors, begin to perfectly autoencode the sequences. So while p' is very low, it's almost impossible later to sample from those dense distributions. We tried this for VAEs as well, but even with different annealing schemes for the KL term we never managed to obtain high-quality samples, nothing comparable to our discrete results. Notably, this experience with dense autoencoders for language has been replicated by others. So our discrete method is at present the only way we know of to make autoencoders work well for language models. We hope that the reviewer will take this into account and revise the score. We are also happy to include more evaluations and will be grateful for more concrete suggestions of metrics that could be used."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Discrete Autoencoders for Sequence Models","abstract":"Recurrent models for sequences have been recently successful at many tasks, especially for language modeling\nand machine translation.

On a measure that they propose, they should it outperforms an alternative Gumbel-Softmax method for both language modeling and NMT.\n\nThe proposed method seems effective, and the proposed DSAE metric is nice, though it’s surprising if previous papers have not used metrics similar to normalized reduction in log-ppl. The datasets considered in the experiments are also large, another plus. However, overall, the paper is difficult to read and parse, especially since low-level details are weaved together with higher-level points throughout, and are often not motivated.\n\nThe major critique would be the qualitative nature of results in the sections on “Decipering the latent code” and (to a lesser extent) “Mixed sample-beam decoding.” These two sections are simply too anecdotal, although it is nice being stepped through the reasoning for the single example considered in Section 3.3.
