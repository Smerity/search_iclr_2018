The discussion is largely based on a sequence of experiments, some of which are interesting and insightful. The discussion here can be useful for other researchers. \n\nMy main concern is that the result here is purely empirical, with no concrete theoretical justification. What the experiments reveal is an empirical correlation between the Eigval index and training accuracy, which can be caused by lots of reasons (and cofounders), and does not necessarily establish a causal relation. Therefore, i found many of the discussion to be questionable. I would love to see more solid theoretical discussion to justify the hypothesis proposed in this paper.\n \nDo you have a sense how accurate is the estimation of the tail probabilities of the eigenvalues? Because the whole paper is based on the approximation of the eigval indexes, it is critical to exam the estimation is accurate enough to draw the conclusions in the paper. \n\nAll the conclusions are based on one or two datasets. Could you consider testing the result on more different datasets to verify if the results are generalizable?

They then demonstrate that skip connections can reduce the prevalence of these singularities, and thus speed up learning.\n\nThe analysis is thorough: the authors explore alternative methods of reducing the singularities, and explore the skip connection properties that more strongly reduce the singularities, and make observations consistent with their overarching claims.\n\nI have no major criticisms.\n\nOne suggestion for future work would be to provide a procedure for users to tailor their skip connection matrices to maximize learning speed and efficacy. The authors could then use this procedure to make highly trainable networks, and show that on test (not training) data, the resultant network leads to high performance.","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Skip Connections Eliminate Singularities","abstract":"Skip connections made the training of very deep networks possible and have become an indispensable component in a variety of neural architectures.
