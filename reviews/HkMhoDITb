It seems to be targeted towards a physics/quantum hardware crowd rather than a machine learning audience. I think most readers, even those very familiar with probabilistic models and RL, would find reading the paper difficult due to jargon/terminology and poorly explained concepts. The paper would need a major rewrite to be of interest to the ML community.\"\n\n- We definitely want to make our work accessible to the ML community so we find your guidance extremely helpful. We have added more details about the algorithm. We added further explanations on classical and quantum Boltzmann machines, the similarities and differences between the two, and how the quantum BMs generalize their classical counterparts. We have used and referred to the terminology of  “Reinforcement Learning with Factored States and Actions” by Brian Sallans and Geoffrey E. Hinton as much as possible for further clarity.\n\n\"Relevance: RL, probabilistic models, and function approximators are all relevant topics. However, the focus of the paper seems to be on parts (like hardware aspects) that are not particularly relevant to the ML community. I have a hard time imagining follow-up work on this, given that the experiments are run on a toy task and require specialized hardware (so they would be extremely difficult to reproduce/improve upon).\"\n\n- We hope that our work serves a small part in setting the ground foundations of new trends in applicability of quantum and exotic hardware in solving real-world machine learning problems. We foresee that a collaboration between the physics and ML community can be crucial to achieving this goal. The quantum computing community is working diligently on making the prototype hardwares accessible through cloud services and to provide user-friendly packages and APIs that hide the cumbersome details and encourage engagement of researchers from other disciplines. \n\n\"Soundness: I can't judge the technical soundness as it is mostly outside my expertise. I wonder if the main algorithm the work is based on (Crawford et al, 2016) has been peer-reviewed (citation appears to be a preprint, and couldn't find a conference/journal version).\"\n\n- Crawford et al (2016) is peer reviewed, being accepted for publication in Quantum Information & Computation (early 2018), presented as a talk at Theory of Quantum Computation (2017), and presented as a poster at Adiabatic Quantum Computation (2017).\n\n\"Significance: It's good to know that the the quantum annealing machine can be used for RL. However, the method of choice (free-energy based Q-function approximation) seems a bit exotic, and the experimental results are extremely underwhelming (5x3 gridworld).\"\n\n- Free-energy based Q-function approximation is an exotic choice for classical computations but a natural choice in the context of Quantum Annealers. We agree that the experimental results are underwhelming due to limitations to the existing prototype hardware and the computationally expensive classical simulations. Moving to larger and more useful benchmarks is definitely the most important future direction to this work. \n\nThank you again for your helpful review, we hope that we have been able to address your concerns."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Reinforcement Learning via Replica Stacking of Quantum Measurements for the Training of Quantum Boltzmann Machines","abstract":"Recent theoretical and experimental results suggest the possibility of using current and near-future quantum hardware in challenging sampling tasks.

The potential collaboration the can result from such exposition would be invaluable to investigating applicability of quantum computing in real-world computational tasks.\n\n\"What the authors called \"Free energy-based reinforcement learning\" seems to me just the minimization / maximiation of the free energy. This is simply maximum likelihood applied to the free energy and I think that calling it \"reinforcement learning\" is not only wrong, but also is very confusing, given this is usually reserved to an entirely different learning process. \"\n\n- We in fact solve Bellman’s optimality equation rather than minimization/maximization of the free energy. The temporal difference is what is minimized rather than maximum likelihood. The roll of free-energy is to act as a function approximation for the Q-function. Please also refer to “Reinforcement Learning with Factored States and Actions” by Brian Sallans and Geoffrey E. Hinton. We would love to hear your feedback if this clarifies what free-energy based reinforcement learning is meant here. Do you mean that the core idea of replica stacking can be applied not only to Reinforcement Learning but to other machine learning paradigms?\n\n\"While i liked the introduction of the quantum Boltzmann machine, I would be happy to learn what they can do? Are these useful, for instance, to study correlated fermions/bosons? The paper does not explain why one should be concerns with these devices.\"\n\n- The quantum Boltzmann machines are generalization of classical Boltzmann machines, so, in theory, QBMs can replace BMs in all the tasks in which BMs are used. However, the details of how to obtain the samples and other statistics required for the specific task need to be investigated since preparing and reading classical (digital) data from quantum systems is not straightforward: any measurement of a quantum system results collapse of the wavefunction which consequently \"stops\" the quantum algorithm. In this paper we work out such details for our specific task (i.e. sampling from the transverse-field Ising model).  \n\n\" The fact that the simulation on a classical computer agrees with the one on a quantum computer is promising, but I would say that this shows that, so far, there is not yet a clear advantage in using a quantum computer. This might change, but in the mean time, what is the benefits for the ICLR community?\"\n\n- You’re definitely right that the agreement between the classical simulation and quantum experiment is a verifying step for the proposal here. However, the classical simulations are extremely slow and that is where the advantage in using a quantum computer may lie. Furthermore, even using Monte-Carlo methods only special quantum systems can be simulated classically (this is known as the sign-problem; See for instance arXiv:cond-mat/0408370.) For specific systems without sign problem, Monte-Carlo methods could be viable simulation methods if implemented on specialized hardware (e.g. ASICS). This can potentially result \"quantum-inpsired\" algorithms that run on classical hardware but take advantage of the extended representational power of the quantum model.\n\nThank you again for taking the time to review our work, your comments have given us a chance to clarify the intent."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Reinforcement Learning via Replica Stacking of Quantum Measurements for the Training of Quantum Boltzmann Machines","abstract":"Recent theoretical and experimental results suggest the possibility of using current and near-future quantum hardware in challenging sampling tasks.

The RBM curve in this figure is the only classical method. Fig 4 demonstrates the performance of the deep Q network which is another classical method considered for comparison.

However, it is an exciting research area and this paper is an interesting demonstration of the feasibility of using quantum annealers for reinforcement learning. \n\nThis paper builds on Crawford et al. (2016), an unpublished preprint, who develop a quantum Boltzmann machine reinforcement learning algorithm (QBM-RL). A QBM consists of adding a transverse field term to the RBM Hamiltonian (negative log likelihood), but the benefits of this for unsupervised tasks are unclear (c.f. https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02036, another unpublished preprint). QBM-RL consists of using a QBM to model the state-action variables: it is an undirected graphical model whose visible nodes are clamped to observed state-action pairs. The hidden nodes model dependencies between states and actions, and the weights of the model are updated to maximize the free energy or Q function (value of the state-action pair).\n\nThe authors extend QBM-RL to work with quantum annealers such as the D-Wave 2000Q, which has a specific bipartite graph structure and requires special consideration because it can only yield samples of hidden variables in a fixed basis. To overcome this, the authors develop a Suzuki-Trotter expansion and call it 'replica stacking', where a classical Hamiltonian in one dimension higher is used to approximate the quantum Hamiltonian. This enables the use of quantum annealers. The authors compare their method to standard baselines in a grid world environment.\n\nOverall, I do not want to criticize the work. It is an interesting proof of concept. But given the high price of quantum annealers, limited applicability of the technique, and unclear benefits of the authors' method, I do not think it is relevant to this specific conference. It may be better suited to a workshop specific to quantum machine learning methods. \n=======================================\n+ please add an algorithm box for your method. It deviates significantly from QBM-RL. For example, something like: (1) init weights of boltzmann machine randomly (2) sample c_eff ~ C from the pool of configurations sampled from the transverse-field Ising model using a quantum annealer with chimera graph (3) using the samples, calculate effective classical hamiltonian used to approximate the quantum system (4) use the weight update rules derived from Bellman equations (spell out the rules). \n\n+ moving the details of sampling into the appendix would help; they are not important for understanding the main ingredients of your method\n\nThere are so many moving parts in your system, and someone without a physics background will struggle to understand it. Clarifying the algorithm in terms familiar to machine learning researchers will go a long way toward helping people understand your method. \n\n+ the benefits of your method is unclear - it looks like the method works, but doesn't outperform the others. this is fine, but it is better to be straightforward about this and bill it as a 'proof of concept' \n\n+ perhaps consider rebranding the paper as something like 'RL using replica stacking for sampling from quantum boltzmann machines with quantum annealers'. Elucidating why replica stacking is a crucial contribution of your work would be helpful, and could be of broad interest in the machine learning community. Right now it is too dense to be useful for the average person without a physics background: what difficulties are intrinsic to a quantum Hamiltonian? What is the intuition behind the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition you develop? What is the 'quantum' Boltzmann machine in machine learning terms (hidden-hidden connections in an undirected graphical model!)? What is replica-stacking in graphical model terms (this would be a great ML contribution in its own right!)?

The experimental results show that our technique is a promising method for harnessing the power of quantum sampling in reinforcement learning tasks.","pdf":"/pdf/4c35435e5f05e10850e036ca686a1078c8fb8315.pdf","TL;DR":"We train Quantum Boltzmann Machines using a replica stacking method and a quantum annealer to perform a reinforcement learning task.","paperhash":"anonymous|reinforcement_learning_via_replica_stacking_of_quantum_measurements_for_the_training_of_quantum_boltzmann_machines","_bibtex":"@article{\n  anonymous2018free,\n  title={Free energy-based reinforcement learning using a quantum processor},\n  author={Anonymous},\n  journal={International Conference on Learning Representations},\n  year={2018},\n  url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkMhoDITb}\n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper19/Authors"],"keywords":["Quantum Annealing","Reinforcement Learning","Boltzmann Machines","Markov Chain Monte Carlo"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":7,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"}],"limit":2000,"offset":0}
