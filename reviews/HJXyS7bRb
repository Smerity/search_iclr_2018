The authors say that in contrast to Lewis et al. their “setting enforces the isolation of information between the models of the two agents” - I’m not sure what this means, but the agents in Lewis et al. each have information that the other does not.

Both the previous work (Lewis et al., 2017) and the proposed approach pitch two agents against each other and the agents communicate via language utterances alone (e.g. rather than exchanging hidden states). In the previous work, the two agents share a set of initial conditions (the set of objects to be divided; this is required by the nature of the task: negotiation), but the goals of each agent are hidden and the negotiation process and outcome are only revealed through natural language. Could you expand on your claim regarding information isolation? Could you design an experiment which highlights the contribution and provide a comparison with the previous approach?\n\nFurthermore, divergence from natural language when optimizing the task reward remains an issue. As a result, both methods require alternate training between the supervised loss and the reinforcement loss.\n\nExperiments:\n\n1. Minor question: During self-play \"we conduct 1 supervised training using the training data every time we make a reinforcement update\". One iteration or one epoch of supervised training?\n\n2. The method is only evaluated on a toy dataset where both the structure of the dialog is limited (see figure 2) and the sentences themselves (the number of language templates is not provided). The referenced negotiation paper uses data collected from mechanical turk ensuring more diversity and the dataset is publicly available. Couldn't your method be applied to that setting for comparison?\n\n3. The qualitative evaluation shows compelling examples from the model. Are the results hand-picked to highlight the two outcomes? I wish more examples and some statistics regarding the diversity of produced dialogs were provided (e.g. how many times to they result in a booked flight vs. unfulfilled request and compare that with the training data).\n\n4. What is the difference between evaluation reward reported in Table 4 and self-play evaluation reward reported in Table 5? (Is the former obtained by conditioning on target utterances?). Is there a reason to not report the itemized rewards in Table 5 as well (Eval flight, Eval action) etc?\n\n5. The use of the value network vs. the policy network is not clarified in the model description nor in the experiments. Is the value network used to reduce the variance in the reward?\n\nFinally, there are several typos or grammatical errors, including:\n- Page 4, t and i should be the same.\n- Page 4.

The paper is not clear is more part and human evaluation is missing.","rating":"6: Marginally above acceptance threshold","review":"I like the idea of coupling the language and the conversation model. This is in line with the latest trends of constructing end-to-end NN models that deal with the conversation in a holistic manner. The idea of enforcing information isolation is brilliant. Creating hidden information and allowing the two-party model to learn through self-play is a very interesting approach and the results seem promising. \n\nHaving said that, I feel important references are missing and specific statements of the paper, like that \"Their success is however limited to conversations with very few turns and without goals\" can be argued. There are papers that are goal oriented and have many turns. I will just provide one example, to avoid being overwhelming, although more can be found in the literature. That would be the paper of T.-H. Wen, D. Vandyke, N. Mrksic, M. Gasic, L. Rojas-Barahona, P.-H. Su, S. Ultes and S. Young (2017). \"A Network-based End-to-End Trainable Task-oriented Dialogue System.\" EACL 2017, Valencia, Spain. In fact in this paper even more dialogue modules are coupled. So, the \"fresh challenge\" of the paper can be argued. \n\nIt is not clear to me how you did the supervised part of the training. To my experience, although supervised learning can be used, reinforcement learning seems to be the most popular choice. Also, I had to read most of the paper to understand that the system is based on a simulator. Additionally, it is not clear how you got the ground-truth for the training. How are the action and the dialogue generated by the simulator guaranteed to follow the optimal policy?\n \nI also disagree with the statement that \"based on those... to estimate rewards\". If ruled-based systems were sufficient, there would not be a need for statistical dialogue managers. However, the latter is a very active research area. \n\nFigure 1 is missing information (for my likings), like not defined symbols. In addition, it's not self-contained. Also, I would prefer a longer, descriptive and informative label to make the figure as self-explained as possible. I believe it would add to the clarity of the paper. \n\nAlso, fundamental information, according to my opinion is missing. For example, what are the restrictions R and how is the database K formed? What is the size of the database? How many actions do you define? Some of them are defined in the action state decoder, but it is not clear if it is all of them.\n\n\nGRU -> abbreviation not defined\n\nI would really appreciate a figure to better explain the subsection \"Encoding External Knowledge\". In the current form I am struggling to understand what the authors mean. \n\nHow is the embedding matrix E created?\n\nHave you tried different unit sizes d? Have you tried different unit sizes for the customer and the service? \n\n\"we use 2 transformation matrixes\" -> if you could please provide more details\n\nHow is equation 2 related to figure 1? \n\nTypo: \"name of he person\"\n\n\"During the supervised learning... and the action states\". I am not sure I get what you mean. May you make this statement more clearly by adding an equation for example?\n\nWhat happens if you use random rather than supervised learning weight initialisation? \n\nEquation 7: What does T stand for?\n\nI cannot find Table 1, 2 and 5 referred to in-text. Moreover I am not sure about quite some items. For example, what is number db? What is the inference set? \n\n500k of data is quite some. A figure on convergence would be nice.\n\nSetting generator: You mention the percentage of book and flight not found. What about the rest of the cases? \n\n\nTypo: “table 3 and table 3”\n\nThe set of the final states of the dialogue is not the same as the ones presented at Fig. 2.\n\nSub section reward generation is poorly described. After all, reward seems to play a very important role for the proposed system. Statements like  “things such as” (instead the exhaustive list of rules for example) or “the error against the optimal distance” with no note what should be considered the optimal distance make the paper clarity decreased and the results not possible to be reproduced. Personally I would prefer to see some equations or a flow chart. By the way, have you tried and alternative reward function? \n\n\nTable 4 is not easy for me to understand. For example, what do you mean when you say eval reward?\n\nImplementation details. I fail to understand how the supervised learning is used (as said already). Also you make a note for the value network, but not for the policy network. \n\nThere are some minor issues with the references such as pomdp or lstm not being capitalised\n\n\nIn general, I believe that the paper has a great potential and is a noticeable work. However, \nthe paper could be better organised. Personally, I struggled with the clarity of some text portions.\nFor me, the main drawback of the paper is that it was't tested with human users. The actual success of the system when evaluated by humans can be surprisingly different from the one that comes from simulation.
