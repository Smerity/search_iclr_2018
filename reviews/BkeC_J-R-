These are minor annoyances; there were some typos and a strange citation format. There is nothing wrong with the fundamental idea itself, but given the experimental results it just is not clear that it is working.\n\nThe bot performance significantly better than the fully trained agent. This leads to a few questions:\n\n1. What was the performance of the \"regression policy\", that was learned during the supervised pretraining phase?\n2. Given enough time would the basic RL agent reach similar performance? (Guessing no...) Why not?\n3. Considering the results of Figure 3 (right) shouldn't the conclusion be that the RL portion is essentially contributing nothing?\n\nPros:\nThe regularization of the Q-values w.r.t. the policy of another agent is interesting\n\nCons:\nNot very well setup experiments\nPerformance is lower than you would expect just using supervised training\nNot clear what parts are working and what parts are not\n\n\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Combination of Supervised and Reinforcement Learning For Vision-Based Autonomous Control","abstract":"Reinforcement learning methods have recently achieved impressive results on a wide range of control problems.

Unlike their claim in the paper, the idea of combining supervised and RL is not new. A good example of this is a supervised actor-critic by Barto (2004). I think even alphaGo uses some form of supervision. However, if I understand correctly, it seems that combining supervision of RL at a later fine-tuning phase by considering supervision as a regularization term is an interesting idea that seems novel.\n\nHaving the luxury of some supervised episodes is of course useful. The first step of building a supervised initial model looks straight forward. The next step of the algorithm is less easy to follow, and presentation of the ideas could be much better. This part of the paper leaves me already with many questions such as why is it essential to consider only a deterministic case and also to consider greedy optimization? Doesn’t this prevent exploration? What are the network parameters (e.g. size of layers) etc. I am not sure I could redo the work from the provided information.\n\nOverall, it is unclear to me what the advantage of the algorithm is over pure supervised learning, and I don’t think a compelling case has been made. Since the influence of the supervision is increased by increasing alpha, it can be expected that results should be better for increasing alpha. The results seem to indicate that an intermediate level of alpha is best, though I would even question the statistical significance by looking at the curves in Figure 3. Also, what is the epoch number, and why is this 1 for alpha=0? If the combination of supervised learning with RL is better, than this should be clearly stated. Some argument is made that pure supervision is overfitting, but would one then not simply add some other regularizer? \n\nThe presentation could also be improved with some language edits. Several articles are wrongly placed and even some meaning is unclear. For example, the phrase “continuous input sequence” does not make sense; maybe you mean “input sequence of real valued quantities”.\n\nIn summary, while the paper contains some good ideas, I certainly think it needs more work to make a clear case for this method. \n","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Combination of Supervised and Reinforcement Learning For Vision-Based Autonomous Control","abstract":"Reinforcement learning methods have recently achieved impressive results on a wide range of control problems.

It provides two main contributions: pre-training the policy network of a DDPG agent in a supervised manner so that it begins in reasonable state-action distribution and regalurizing the Q-updates of the q-network to be biased towards existing actions.  The authors use the TORCS enviroment to demonstrate the performance of their method both in final cumulative return of the policy and speed of learning.\n\nThis paper is easy to understand but has a couple shortcomings and some fatal (but reparable) flaws:.\n\n1) When using RL please try to standardize your notation to that used by the community, it makes things much easier to read.  I would strongly suggest avoiding your notation a(x|\\Theta) and using \\pi(x) (subscripting theta or making conditional is somewhat less important).  Your a(.) function seems to be the policy here, which is invariable denoted \\pi in the RL literature.  There has been recent effort to clean up RL notation which is presented here: https://sites.ualberta.ca/~szepesva/papers/RLAlgsInMDPs.pdf. You have no obligation to use this notation but it does make reading of your paper much easier on others in the community.  This is more of a shortcoming than a fundamental issue.\n\n2) More fatally, you have failed to compare your algorithm's performance against benchline implementations of similar algorithms.  It is almost trivial to run DDPG on Torcs using the openAI baselines package [https://github.com/openai/baselines].  I would have loved, for example, to see the effects of simply pre-training the DDPG actor on supervised data, vs. adding your mixture loss on the critic.  Using the baselines would have (maybe) made a very compelling graph showing DDPG, DDPG + actor pre-training, and then your complete method.\n\n3) And finally, perhaps complementary to point 2), you really need to provide examples on more than one environment.  Each of these simulated environments has its own pathologies linked to determenism, reward structure, and other environment particularities.  Almost every algorithm I've seen published will often beat baselines on one environment and then fail to improve or even be wors on others, so it is important to at least run on a series of these.  Mujoco + AI Gym should make this really easy to do (for reference, I have no relatinship with OpenAI).  Running at least cartpole (which is a very well understood control task), and then perhaps reacher, swimmer, half-cheetah etc. using a known contoller as your behavior policy (behavior policy is a good term for your data-generating policy.)\n\n4) In terms of state of the art you are very close to Todd Hester et. al's paper on imitation learning, and although you cite it, you should contrast your approach more clearly with the one in that paper.  Please also have a look at some more recent work my Matej Vecerik, Todd Hester & Jon Scholz: 'Leveraging Demonstrations for Deep Reinforcement Learning on Robotics Problems with Sparse Rewards' for an approach that is pretty similar to yours.\n\nOverall I think your intuitions and ideas are good, but the paper does not do a good enough job justifying empirically that your approach provides any advantages over existing methods.  The idea of pre-training the policy net has been tried before (although I can't find a published reference) and in my experience will help on certain problems, and hinder on others, primarily because the policy network is already 'overfit' somewhat to the expert, and may have a hard time moving to a more optimal space.  Because of this experience I would need more supporting evidence that your method actually generalizes to more than one RL environment.","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Combination of Supervised and Reinforcement Learning For Vision-Based Autonomous Control","abstract":"Reinforcement learning methods have recently achieved impressive results on a wide range of control problems.
