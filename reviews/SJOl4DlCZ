In Figure 6, only a few images are classified as Keanu Reeves with prob>0.8, while most of the images generated by PreImageGAN are recognized as Keanu Reeves with prob>0.95. This indicates that PreImageGAN can generate images recognized as the target only from auxiliary images that are not recognized as the target.\nSecond, to show that PreImageGAN used the \"magic\" to stitch characteristics of different face identities, we generated images of interpolation between two people in Figure 8.

It is unclear to me if the generated distribution in the experiments is similar to the original distribution D_tr given y = t^\\*, either from inception accuracy or from pictorial illustration.\n\nWe agree that it is preferable to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method quantitatively. Unfortunately, in our problem setting, the true generative distribution is unknown, and it is impossible to measure the utility of the resulting generative model. Instead, we employed the inception accuracy as employed in ACGAN.\n\n>Since we have hold out the training data, perhaps we can measure the distance between the generated distribution and D_tr given y = t^\\* directly.\n\nI guess the method you suggested is to measure the divergence between the model obtained by the PreImageGAN and the GAN model learned from the training dataset. Even when we have a holdout dataset, it would be difficult to measure the difference between two GANs because GANs often do not give densities or likelihoods. This topic itself is an attractive future direction but is out of the scope of this study.\n\n\n>2. It would be great if we can provide experiments quantifying the utility of the auxiliary examples. For example, when they are completely noise, can we still get sensible generation of images?\n\nTo see how much the quality of the auxiliary dataset affects to the generated images, we tried the C2G attack with using meaningless auxiliary images, that is, uniform noise images.\nAs clearly shown in the results (Figure 7), meaningless auxiliary images cannot give meaningful results.\nFrom these results, we could experimentally confirm that the auxiliary dataset affects the quality of the resulting images significantly.\n\n\n>3. How does the experimental result of this approach compare with model attack? For example, we can imagine generating labels by e_t^\\* + epsilon, where epsilon is random noise. If we invert these random labels, do we get a distribution of examples from class t^\\*?\n\nWe guess the reviewer mentioned the model inversion attack [A,B].\nIf the model is shallow as already tried in [A] and [B], model inversion will give the distribution of the target images as suggested by the reviewer.\nHowever, unfortunately, model inversion does not work with deep architecture as already tested by [C].\nThis is a major motivation that we designed the C2G attack using PreImageGAN.\n\n\n[A] Matt Fredrikson, Somesh Jha, and Thomas Ristenpart.

Its solution is based on a new GAN: preImageGAN. Three settings of the similarity between auxillary distribution and training distribution is considered: exact same, partly same, mutually exclusive. Experiments show promising results in generating examples from the original training distribution, even in the \"mutually exclusive\" setting.\n\nQuality: \n1. It is unclear to me if the generated distribution in the experiments is similar to the original distribution D_tr given y = t^*, either from inception accuracy or from pictorial illustration. Since we have hold out the training data, perhaps we can measure the distance between the generated distribution and D_tr given y = t^* directly.\n\n2. It would be great if we can provide experiments quantifying the utility of the auxillary examples. For example, when they are completely noise, can we still get sensible generation of images? \n\n3. How does the experimental result of this approach compare with model attack? For example, we can imagine generating labels by e_t^* + epsilon, where epsilon is random noise. If we invert these random labels, do we get a distribution of examples from class t^*?\n\nClarity:\n1. I think the key here is to first generate auxillary labels (as in Figure 2), then solve optimization problem (3) - this causes my confusion at first sight. (My first impression is that all labels, training or auxillary, are one-hot encoding - but this makes no sense since the dimension of f and y_aux does not match.)\n\nOriginality: I am not familiar with relevant literature - and I think the GAN formulation here is original.\n\nSignificance: I see this as a nice step towards inferring training data from trained classifiers. \n\n","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Classifier-to-Generator Attack: Estimation of Training Data Distribution from Classifier","abstract":"Suppose a deep classification model is trained with samples that need to be kept private for privacy or confidentiality reasons.
