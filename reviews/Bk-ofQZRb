The experiments with Baird's and CartPole were both convincing as preliminary evidence that this could be effective. However, it is very hard to generalize from these toy problems. First, we really need a more thorough analysis of what this does to the learning dynamics itself. Baring theoretical results, you could analyze the changes to the value function at the current and next state with and without the constraint to illustrate the effects more directly. I think ideally, I would want to see this on Atari or some of the continuous control domains often used. If this allows the removing of the target network for instance, in those more difficult tasks, then this would be a huge deal.\n\nAdditionally, I do not think the current gridworld task adds anything to the experiments, I would rather actually see this on a more interesting linear function approximation on some other simple task like Mountain Car than a neural network on gridworld. The reason this might be interesting is that when the parameter space is lower dimensional (not an issue for neural nets, but could be problematic for linear FA) the constraint might be too much leading to significantly poorer performance. I suspect this is the actual cause for it not converging to zero for Baird's, although please correct me if I'm wrong on that.\n\nAs is, I cannot recommend acceptance given the current experiments and lack of theoretical results. But I do think this is a very interesting direction and hope to see more thorough experiments or analysis to support it.\n\nPros:\nSimple, interesting idea\nWorks well on toy problems, and able to prevent divergence in Baird's counter-example\n\nCons:\nLacking in theoretical analysis or significant experimental results\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"TD Learning with Constrained Gradients","abstract":"Temporal Difference Learning with function approximation is known to be unstable.

The constraint is added by projecting the original gradient to the orthogonal of the maximal direction of change of the next state’s value. It is shown empirically that the constrained update does not diverge on Baird’s counter example and improves performance in a grid world domain and cart pole over DQN.\n\nThis paper is reasonably readable. The derivation for the constraint is easy to understand and seems to be an interesting line of inquiry that might show potential.\n\nThe key issue is that the justification for the constrained gradients is lacking. What is the effect, in terms of convergence, in modifying the gradient in this way? It seems highly problematic to simply remove a whole part of the gradient, to reduce effect on the next state. For example, if we are minimizing the changes our update will make to the value of the next state, what would happen if the next state is equivalent to the current state (or equivalent in our feature space)? In general, when we project our update to be orthogonal to the maximal change of the next states value, how do we know it is a valid direction in which to update? \n\nI would have liked some analysis of the convergence results for TD learning with this constraint, or some better intuition in how this effects learning. At the very least a mention of how the convergence proof would follow other common proofs in RL. This is particularly important, since GTD provides convergent TD updates under nonlinear function approximation; the role for a heuristic constrained TD algorithm given convergent alternatives is not clear. \n \nFor the experiments, other baselines should be included, particularly just regular Q-learning. The primary motivation comes from the use of a separate target network in DQN, which seems to be needed in Atari (though I am not aware of any clear result that demonstrates why, rather just from informal discussions). Since you are not running experiments on Atari here, it is invalid to simply assume that such a second network is needed. A baseline of regular Q-learning should be included for these simpler domains. \n\nThe results in Baird’s counter example are discouraging for the new constraints. Because we already have algorithms which better solve this domain, why is your method advantageous? The point of showing your algorithm not solve Baird’s counter example is unclear.\n\nThere are also quite a few correctness errors in the paper, and the polish of the plots and language needs work, as outlined below. \n\nThere are several mistakes in the notation and background section. \n1. “If we consider TD-learning using function approximation, the loss that is minimized is the squared TD error.“ This is not true; rather, TD minimizes the mean-squared project Bellman error. Further, L_TD is strangely defined: why a squared norm, for a scalar value? \n2. The definition of v and delta_TD w.r.t. to v seems unnecessary, since you only use Q. As an additional (somewhat unimportant) point, the TD-error is usually defined as the negative of what you have. \n3. In the function approximation case the value function and q functions parameterized by \\theta are only approximations of the expected return.\n4. Defining the loss w.r.t. the state, and taking the derivative of the state w.r.t. to theta is a bit odd. Likely what you meant is the q function, at state s_t? Also, are ignoring the gradient of the value at the next step? If so, this further means that this is not a true gradient.  \n\nThere is a lot of white space around the plots, which could be used for larger more clear figures. The lack of labels on the plots makes them hard to understand at a glance, and the overlapping lines make finding certain algorithm’s performance much more difficult. I would recommend combining the plots into one figure with a drawing program so you have more control over the size and position of the plots.\n\nExamples of odd language choices:\n\t-\t“The idea also does not immediately scale to nonlinear function approximation. Bhatnagar et al. (2009) propose a solution by projecting the error on the tangent plane to the function at the point at which it is evaluated. “ - The paper you give exactly solves for the nonlinear function approximation case. What do you mean does not scale to nonlinear function approximation? Also Maei is the first author on this paper.\n\t-\t“Though they do not point out this insight as we have” - This seems to be a bit overreaching.\n- “the gradient at s_{t+1} that will change the value the most”  - This is too colloquial. I think you simply mean the gradient of the value function, for the given s_t, but its not clear.

The proposed algorithm constrains the gradient update to deal with the fact that canonical TD with function approximation ignores the impact of changing the weights on the target of the TD learning rule. Results with linear and non-linear function approximation highlight the attributes of the method.\n\nQuality: The quality of the writing, notation, motivation, and results analysis is low. I will give a few examples to highlight the point. The paper motivates that TD is divergent with function approximation, and then goes on to discuss MSPBE methods that have strong convergence results, without addressing why a new approach is needed. There are many missing references: ETD, HTD, mirror-prox methods, retrace, ABQ. Q-sigma. This is a very active area of research and the paper needs to justify their approach. The paper has straightforward technical errors and naive statements: e.g. the equation for the loss of TD takes the norm of a scalar. The paper claims that it is not well-known that TD with function approximation ignores part of the gradient of the MSVE. There are many others.\n\nThe experiments have serious issues. Exp1 seems to indicate that the new method does not converge to the correct solution. The grid world experiment is not conclusive as important details like the number of episodes and how parameters were chosen was not discussed. Again exp3 provides little information about the experimental setup.\n\nClarity: The clarity of the text is fine, though errors make things difficult sometimes. For example The Bhatnagar 2009 reference should be Maei.\n \nOriginality: As mentioned above this is a very active research area, and the paper makes little effort to explain why the multitude of existing algorithms are not suitable. \n\nSignificance: Because of all the things outlined above, the significance is below the bar for this round.
