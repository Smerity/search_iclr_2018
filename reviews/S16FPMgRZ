Tensor Contraction can be seen as a generalisation of bilinear pooling to any arbitrary number of dimensions.\n  \n[1] (Attribute-Enhanced Face Recognition with Neural Tensor Fusion) proposes a feature fusion method as a tensor optimisation problem. Specifically, it performs fusion from two feature vectors and the framework is therefore limited to a third order weight tensor with two vector inputs.\n\nOur work is significantly different from these:\nWe propose to preserve and leverage the tensor structure of the activations. We do so by introducing new generic, end-to-end trainable layers that allow large space savings while preserving the multi-dimensional structure. Specifically, we introduce Tensor Contraction Layers (TCL) that reduce the dimension of the input while preserving its multi-linear structure, and Tensor Regression Layer (TRL) that directly maps an input tensor to an output tensor using low-rank regression weights.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Tensor Contraction & Regression Networks","abstract":"Convolution neural networks typically consist of many convolutional layers followed by several fully-connected layers.

This is done by performing CP decomposition on the convolution kernel before fine-tuning the whole network.\n\nThese papers only focus on decomposing the weight tensors. By contrast, we propose to preserve the multi-linear structure of the activation throughout the network. In particular TCL focuses on contraction activation tensors. Additionally, those works focus on the convolutional kernels, where the number of parameters is already quite small, while our work is focused on eliminating the standard flattening and fully-connected layers\n\nNote that in the TCL, we do not assume a Tucker form of the activation tensors but rather apply tensor contraction to them to reduce their dimensionality. Similarly, TRL is a new layer that does not simply consist in assuming a Tucker form of the regression weight but directly maps an input tensor to an output tensor using low-rank regression tensor weights. It can be used to replace the flattening and fully-connected layers in traditional network architectures.\n\nOur contribution is the introduction of these two novel layers, trainable end-to-end using gradient backpropagation. Being able to these train end-to-end is crucial to be able to learn the whole network jointly (most existing tensor methods are solved analytically, and existing work on deep learning and tensor decomposition focuses mainly on pre-training a network, applying some sort of decomposition to the weights and fine-tuning. By training end-to-end we learn the whole network jointly).\n\nWe compare with a competitive, state-of-the-art architecture, (ResNet) and show that performance is maintained while showing large space savings. Note that there has been no such attempt in the past to compare with. As we mention in the related work, Novikov et. al. (2015) retain the flattening and fully connected layers for the output while we present an end-to-end tensorized architecture. They obtain space savings by applying tensor decomposition to the weights of some of the fully-connected layers, reshaped as tensors (which also means selecting both the size of the tensor to reshape to, in addition to the rank of the decomposition).\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Tensor Contraction & Regression Networks","abstract":"Convolution neural networks typically consist of many convolutional layers followed by several fully-connected layers.

Regarding the novelty of this work: To our knowledge, no previous papers propose incorporating either tensor contraction or regression as layers in deep neural networks. Instead these methods have previously been studied as stand-alone techniques, where they are solved analytically. Our main contribution is the introduction of these two novel layers, trainable end-to-end via gradient descent and the empirical finding that we can enjoy dramatic space savings with negligible loss in accuracy.\n\nIt is possible that the reviewer has encountered pre-printed versions of this paper.

But we request that the reviewer be careful not to mistakenly hold against this work its previous inclusion in workshops and on the arXiv. \n\n2. Regarding the usefulness of studying the two in combination: We combine the two as they are naturally complementary methods. Tensor contraction reduces the dimensionality of the input tensor, this reduced tensor can then be mapped to an output tensor using tensor regression. \n\nAs shown in figure 5, the performance of the TRL is not very sensitive to the choice of the rank, making that selection easy.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Tensor Contraction & Regression Networks","abstract":"Convolution neural networks typically consist of many convolutional layers followed by several fully-connected layers.

While convolutional layers map between high-order activation tensors, the fully-connected layers operate on flattened activation vectors.  Despite its success, this approach has notable drawbacks. Flattening discards the multi-dimensional structure of the activations, and the fully-connected layers require a large number of parameters. \nWe present two new techniques to address these problems.  First, we introduce tensor contraction layers which can replace the ordinary fully-connected layers in a neural network. Second, we introduce tensor regression layers, which express the output of a neural network as a low-rank multi-linear mapping from a high-order activation tensor to the softmax layer.  Both the contraction and regression weights are learned end-to-end by backpropagation. By imposing low rank on both, we use significantly fewer parameters.
