In particular, I think the rationale for using Batch Normalization's \\gamma scaling factors as the pruning criterion is explained in a very clear fashion. \n\nHowever, given this \"sparsify BN's \\gamma and prune channels accordingly\" technique is already proposed by the ICCV paper [1], I think it would be great to clarify the difference between your work and [1] in more detail, and include an experimental comparison. In my understanding, the essential difference is that you use ISTA to sparsify \\gamma instead of L1 regularization as in [1]. I think including a direct comparison would make the paper more convincing.\n\nMoreover, I think the \"parallel work\" argument might not be fully valid, as [1] was published and presented before ICLR submission, and had already been on Arxiv for more than 2 months before ICLR submission.\n\nNevertheless, I believe the paper is still a good contribution to ICLR if [1] is cited as prior work (rather than parallel work), the difference is clarified in more detail, and a comparison is conducted.\n\n[1] Liu et al.

The idea is quite simple as pruning using the connection in the batch norm layer. It is interesting to add the memory cost per channel into the optimization process. \n\nThe paper suggests normal pruning does not necessarily preserve the network function. I wonder if this is also applicable to the proposed method and how can this be evidenced. \n\nAs strong points, the paper is easy to follow and does a good review of existing methods. Then, the proposal is simple and easy to reproduce and leads to interesting results. It is clearly written (there are some typos / grammar errors). \n\nAs weak points:\n1) The paper claims the selection of \\alpha is critical but then, this is fixed empirically without proper sensitivity analysis. I would like to see proper discussion here. Why is \\alpha set to 1.0 in the first experiment while set to a different number elsewhere. \n\n2) how is the pruning (as post processing) performed for the base model (the so called model A).\n\nIn section 4, in the algorithmic steps.

Right questions but missing answers. ","rating":"4: Ok but not good enough - rejection","review":"In this paper, the authors propose a data-dependent channel pruning approach to simplify CNNs with batch-normalizations. The authors view CNNs as a network flow of information and applies sparsity regularization on the batch-normalization scaling parameter \\gamma which is seen as a “gate” to the information flow. Specifically, the approach uses iterative soft-thresholding algorithm step to induce sparsity in \\gamma during the overall training phase of the CNN (with additional rescaling to improve efficiency. In the experiments section, the authors apply their pruning approach on a few representative problems and networks. \n\nThe concept of applying sparsity on \\gamma to prune channels is an interesting one, compared to the usual approaches of sparsity on weights. However, the ISTA, which is equivalent to L1 penalty on \\gamma is in spirit same as “smaller-norm-less-informative” assumption. Hence, the title seems a bit misleading. \n\nThe quality and clarity of the paper can be improved in some sections. Some specific comments by section:\n\n3. Rethinking Assumptions:\n-\tWhile both issues outlined here are true in general, the specific examples are either artificial or can be resolved fairly easily. For example: L-1 norm penalties only applied on alternate layers is artificial and applying the penalties on all Ws would fix the issue in this case. Also, the scaling issue of W can be resolved by setting the norm of W to 1, as shown in He et. al., 2017. Can the authors provide better examples here?\n-\tCan the authors add specific citations of the existing works which claim to use Lasso, group Lasso, thresholding to enforce parameter sparsity?\n\n4. Channel Pruning\n-\tThe notation can be improved by defining or replacing “sum_reduced”\n-\tISTA – is only an algorithm, the basic assumption is still L1 -> sparsity or smaller-norm-less-informative. Can the authors address the earlier comment about “a theoretical gap questioning existing sparsity inducing formulation and actual computational algorithms”?\n-\tCan the authors address the earlier comment on “how to set thresholds for weights across different layers”, by providing motivation for choice of penalty for each layer? \n-\tCan the authors address the earlier comment on how their approach provides “guarantees for preserving neural net functionality approximately”?\n\n5. Experiments\n-\tCIFAR-10: Since there is loss of accuracy with channel pruning, it would be useful to compare accuracy of a pruned model with other simpler models with similar param.size? (like pruned-resnet-101 vs. resnet-50 in ISLVRC subsection)\n-\tISLVRC: The comparisons between similar param-size models is exteremely useful in highlighting the contribution of this. However, resnet-34/50/101 top-1 error rates from Table 3/4 in (He et.al. 2016) seem to be lower than reported in table 3 here. Can the authors clarify?\n-\tFore/Background: Can the authors add citations for datasets, metrics for this problem?\n\n\nOverall, the channel pruning with sparse \\gammas is an interesting concept and the numerical results seem promising. The authors have started with right motivation and the initial section asks the right questions, however, some of those questions are left unanswered in the subsequent work as detailed above.","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Rethinking the Smaller-Norm-Less-Informative Assumption in Channel Pruning of Convolution Layers","abstract":"Model pruning has become a useful technique that improves the computational efficiency of deep learning, making it possible to deploy solutions on resource- limited scenarios.
