I have uploaded a new revision based on your suggestions.\n\n>  The embedding-enhancing method has low originality but is effective on this particular combination of model architecture, task and datasets. I am left wondering how well it might generalize to other models or tasks, since the problem it addresses shows up in many other places too...\n\nGood point. I will test embedding-enhanced method on other benchmark set/task to check whether it is still effective. I will report results here.\n\n> S3.1 - Word representation layer: This paragraph should probably mention that the character-composed embeddings are newly introduced here\nI updated it in revised version based on your advice.\n\n> What set does P denote, and what is the set-theoretic relation between P and T?\nP: all words in training/validation/testing sets (number of unique words could be large)\nT:  words with word2vec embedding on the training set.  T is a subset of P.  Word2vec also uses word document frequency to remove some low frequency words.\n\nIn the revised version,  I change output  to \" dimension d1 + d2 for (S\\cap P) \\cup T\" and added notes \"The remaining words which are in P and not in the above output dictionary are initialized with zero vectors\".  Here we did not store word with zero vector in the above dictionary to save space in the output dictionary. This initialization is usually done during neural network initialization stage.\n\n> S4.1 - What do the authors mean by the statement that response candidates for the Douban corpus were \"collected by Lucene retrieval model\"?\nBased on your advice, I added the following sentences in the revised paper\n\"That is, the last turn of each Douban dialogue with additional keywords extracted from the context on the test set was used as query to retrieve 10 response candidates from the Lucene index set (Details are referred to section 4 in (Wu et al., 2017)).\" \n\nDouban data was created by Wu et al., not by us (paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01627.pdf, \nSee section 4: Response Candidate retrieval and Section 5.2 Douban Conversation Corpus). On this dataset,  response negative candidates on the training/validation sets were random sampled whereas the retrieved method was used for testing set. \n\n> S4.2 - Paragraph two is very unclear. In particular, I don't understand the role of the Glove vectors here when Algorithm 1 is used, since the authors refer to word2vec vectors later in this paragraph and also in the Algorithm description.\n\nHere GloVe vectors are just pre-trainined word embedding ones from a general large dataset.\n\nFor the clarification,  I added the following sentence  in Section 3.2\n\"Here the pre-trainined word vectors can be from known methods such as GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014), word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) and FastText (Bojanowski et al., 2016).\".\n\nOn the training set we used word2vec in Algorithm 1 though other methods (GloVe and FastText) can be used too. \n\n> S4.3 - It's insufficiently clear what the model definitions are for the Douban corpus. Is there still a character-based LSTM involved, \nI used the same model layout and hyper-parameters for Douban and Ubuntu corpus.  In Section 4.2 \n\"The same hyper-parameter settings are applied to both Ubuntu Dialogue and Douban conversation corpus.\"\n\nOnly the differences are pre-trained embedding vectors and word2vec generated on the training sets.   Wu et al's Douban dataset (Chinese) have been already tokenized so that it is easy for us to run word2vec based on gensim. \n\n> does FastText make it unnecessary?\nFor western languages such as English, Germany, FastText generates ngram (character) internal embeddings and are used to address out-of-vocabulary issue.  For OOV (a word is out of FastText pre-trained embeddings), we can use average of word ngram to obtain its representation. For Ubuntu corpus, I can test it if you think that it is useful.\nFor Douban, it is not easy for us to do it since dataset has been tokenized by Chinese tokenizer.\n\n> S4.3 - \"It can be seen from table 3 that the original ESIM did not perform well without character embedding.\" \nThanks.  I changed it to \"\nIt can be seen from table 3 that character embedding enhances the performance of original ESIM.\"\n\"\n\n> S4.4 - gensim package -- for the benefit of readers unfamiliar with gensim, the text should ideally state explicitly that it is used to create the *word2vec* embeddings, \nI updated it in revised version based on your advice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Enhance Word Representation for Out-of-Vocabulary on Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus","abstract":"Ubuntu dialogue corpus is the largest public available dialogue corpus to make it feasible to build end-to-end\ndeep neural network models directly from the conversation data.

In this new setting, the ESIM model (vanilla and extended) outperform previous models when trained and evaluated on two distinct conversational datasets.\n\n2) A fairly trivial method is proposed to extend the coverage of pre-trained word embeddings to deal with the OOV problem that arises when applying them to these conversational datasets.\nThe method itself is to combine d1-dimensional word embeddings that were pretrained on a large unannotated corpus (vocabulary S) with distinct d2-dimensional word embeddings that are trained on the task-specific training data (vocabulary T). The enhanced (d1+d2)-dimensional representation for a word is constructed by concatenating its vectors from the two embeddings, setting either the d1- or d2-dimensional subvector to zeros when the word is absent from either S or T, respectively. This method is incorporated as an extension into ESIM and evaluated on the two conversation datasets.\n\nThe main results can be characterized as showing that this vocabulary extension method leads to performance gains on two datasets, on top of an ESIM-model extended with character-based word embeddings, which itself outperforms the vanilla ESIM model.\n\nThese empirical results are potentially meaningful and could justify reporting, but the paper's organization is very confusing, and too many details are too unclear, leading to low confidence in reproducibility. \n\nThere is basic novelty in applying the base model to a new task, and the analysis of the role of the special conversational boundary tokens is interesting and can help to inform future modeling choices. The embedding-enhancing method has low originality but is effective on this particular combination of model architecture, task and datasets. I am left wondering how well it might generalize to other models or tasks, since the problem it addresses shows up in many other places too...\n\nOverall, the presentation switches back and forth between the Douban corpus and the Ubuntu corpus, and between word2vec and Glove embeddings, and this makes it very challenging to understand the details fully.\n\nS3.1 - Word representation layer: This paragraph should probably mention that the character-composed embeddings are newly introduced here, and were not part of the original formulation of ESIM. That statement is currently hidden in the figure caption.\n\nAlgorithm 1:\n- What set does P denote, and what is the set-theoretic relation between P and T?\n- Under one possible interpretation, there may be items in P that are in neither T nor S, yet the algorithm does not define embeddings for those items even though its output is described as \"a dictionary with word embeddings ... for P\". This does not seem consistent? I think the sentence in S4.2 about initializing remaining OOV words as zeros is relevant and wonder if it should form part of the algorithm description?\n\nS4.1 - What do the authors mean by the statement that response candidates for the Douban corpus were \"collected by Lucene retrieval model\"?\n\nS4.2 - Paragraph two is very unclear. In particular, I don't understand the role of the Glove vectors here when Algorithm 1 is used, since the authors refer to word2vec vectors later in this paragraph and also in the Algorithm description.\n\nS4.3 - It's insufficiently clear what the model definitions are for the Douban corpus. Is there still a character-based LSTM involved, or does FastText make it unnecessary?\n\nS4.3 - \"It can be seen from table 3 that the original ESIM did not perform well without character embedding.\" This is a curious way to describe the result, when, in fact, the ESIM model in table 3 already outperforms all the previous models listed.\n\nS4.4 - gensim package -- for the benefit of readers unfamiliar with gensim, the text should ideally state explicitly that it is used to create the *word2vec* embeddings, instead of the ambiguous \"word embeddings\".\n\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Enhance Word Representation for Out-of-Vocabulary on Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus","abstract":"Ubuntu dialogue corpus is the largest public available dialogue corpus to make it feasible to build end-to-end\ndeep neural network models directly from the conversation data.

This scheme is shown to perform well compared to other methods, specifically combinations of pretraining vs not pretraining embeddings on the training data, updating vs not updating embeddings during training, and others. \n\nQuality: Low. The research is not very well modularized: the addressed problem has nothing specifically to do with ESIM and dialogue response classification, but it's all tangled up. The proposed solution is reasonable but rather minor. Given that the model will learn task-specific word representations on the training set anyway, it's not clear how important it is to follow this procedure, though minor improvement is reported (Table 5). \n\nClarity: The writing is clear.

The proposed approach uses generic embeddings and combines them with the embeddings trained on the training dataset in a straightforward string-matching algorithm. In addition, the paper also makes a couple of improvements to Chen et. al's enhanced LSTM by adding character-level embeddings and replacing average pooling by LSTM last state summary vector. The results are shown on the standard Ubuntu dialogue dataset as well as a new Douban conversation dataset. The proposed approach gives sizable gains over the baselines.\n\n\nComments:\n\nThe paper is well written and puts itself nicely in context of previous work. Though, the proposed extension to handle out-of-vocabulary items is a simple and straightforward string matching algorithm, but nonetheless it gives noticeable increase in empirical performance on both the tasks. All in all, the methodological novelty of the paper is small but it has high practical relevance in terms of giving improved accuracy on an important task of dialogue conversation.","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Enhance Word Representation for Out-of-Vocabulary on Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus","abstract":"Ubuntu dialogue corpus is the largest public available dialogue corpus to make it feasible to build end-to-end\ndeep neural network models directly from the conversation data.
