As the anonymous reviewer rightly points out, the [MH17] does not look at the standard version of RMSProp but rather a modification and thus, there is no contradiction with our paper. We will make this point clear in the final version of the paper.\n\nRegarding note about learning rate: While it is true that none of these new rates improve upon Adagrad rates, in fact, in the worst case one cannot improve the regret of standard online gradient descent in general convex setting. Adagrad improves this in the special case of sparse gradients (see for instance, Section 1.3 of Duchi et al. 2011). However, these algorithms, which are designed for specific convex settings, appear to perform reasonably well in the nonconvex settings too (especially in deep networks). Exponential moving average (EMA) variants seem to further improve the performance in the (dense) nonconvex setting. Understanding the cause for good performance in nonconvex settings is an interesting open problem. Our aim was to take an initial step to develop more principled EMA approaches. We will add a description in the final version of the paper.\n\nLemma 4: Thanks for pointing it out and sorry for the confusion. Indeed, x1 = z1 and x2 = z2.

Indeed, it is not possible to improve upon the of online gradient descent in the worst case convex settings. Algorithms such as Adagrad exploit structure in the problem such as sparsity to provide improved regret bounds. Theorem 4 provides some adaptivity to sparsity of gradients (but note that these are upper bounds and it is not clear if they are tight). Adaptive methods seem to perform well in few non-sparse and nonconvex settings too. It remains open to understand it in the nonconvex settings of our interest. \n- Indeed, there is a typo; we expect ||g{1:T,i}|| to grow like sqrt(T). The main benefit in adaptive methods comes in terms of sparsity (and dimension dependence). For example see Section 1.3 in Duchi et al. 2011). We have revised the paper to incorporate these changes.\n- We can indeed assume that x_1 = 1 (without loss of generality) because for any choice of initial point, we can always translate the function so that x_1 = 1 is the initial point in the new coordinate system. We will add a discussion about this in the final version of the paper.\n- The last part of Theorem 6 explains the reduction with respect to general epsilon. We will further highlight this in the final version of the paper.\n\nOther remarks:\n\nRegarding widespread adoption of Adam: It is possible that in certain applications the issues we raised in this work are not that severe (although they can still lead to degradation in generalization performance). On the contrary, there exist a large number of real-world applications, for instance training models with large output spaces, which suffer from the issues we have highlighted and non-convergence has been observed to occur more frequently. Often, this non-convergence is attributed to nonconvexity but our paper shows one of the causes that applies even to convex settings. \nAs stated in the paper, using a problem specific large beta2 seems to help in some applications. Researchers have developed many tricks (such as gradient clipping) which might also play a role in mitigating these issues. We propose two different approaches to fix this issue and it will be interesting to investigate these approaches in various applications.\n\nWe have addressed all other minor concerns directly in the revision of the paper.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"On the Convergence of Adam and Beyond","abstract":" Several recently proposed stochastic optimization methods that have been successfully used in training deep networks such as RMSProp, Adam, Adadelta, Nadam, etc are based on using gradient updates scaled by square roots of exponential moving averages of squared past gradients.

We believe that beta1 is not an issue for convergence of Adam (although our theoretical analysis assumes a decreasing beta1). For example, in stochastic convex optimization, momentum based methods have been shown to converge even for constant beta1. That said, it is indeed interesting to develop better understanding of the effect of momentum in convergence of these algorithms (especially in the nonconvex setting).\n\nAs the paper shows, for any constant beta2, there exists a counter-example for non-convergence of Adam (both in online as well as stochastic setting, Theorem 2 & Theorem 3). Using a large beta2 can partially mitigate this issue in practice but it is not clear how high beta2 should be and it is indeed an interesting research question. Our paper proposes a couple of approaches (AMSGrad & AdamNC) for addressing these issues. AMSGrad allows us to use a fixed beta2 by changing the structure of the algorithm (and also allows us to use a much slow decaying learning rate than Adagrad). AdamNC looks at an approach where beta2 changes with t, ultimately converging to 1, hopefully allowing us to retain the benefits of Adam but at the same time circumventing its non-convergence.\n\nThe aim of synthetic experiments was to demonstrate the effect of non-convergence. We can modify it to demonstrate similar problem for any constant beta2.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"On the Convergence of Adam and Beyond","abstract":" Several recently proposed stochastic optimization methods that have been successfully used in training deep networks such as RMSProp, Adam, Adadelta, Nadam, etc are based on using gradient updates scaled by square roots of exponential moving averages of squared past gradients.

Once the problem was identified to be the decrease in v_t (and increase in learning rate), they modified the algorithm to solve that problem. They then show the modified algorithm does indeed converge and show some experimental results comparing it to ADAM.\n\nThe paper is well written, interesting  and very important given the popularity of ADAM. \n\nRemarks:\n- The fact that your algorithm cannot increase the learning rate seems like a possible problem in practice. A large gradient at the first steps due to bad initialization can slow the rest of training. The experimental part is limited, as you state \"preliminary\", which is a unfortunate for a work with possibly an important practical implication.

Moreover, it gives a simple 1-dimensional counterexample with\nlinear losses on which Adam does not converge. The same issue also\naffects RMSprop, which may be viewed as a special case of Adam without\nmomentum. The problem with Adam is that the \"learning rate\" matrices\nV_t^{1/2}/alpha_t are not monotonically decreasing. A new method, called\nAMSGrad is therefore proposed, which modifies Adam by forcing these\nmatrices to be decreasing. It is then shown that AMSGrad does satisfy\nessentially the same convergence bound as the one previously claimed for\nAdam. Experiments and simulations are provided that support the\ntheoretical analysis.\n\nApart from some issues with the technical presentation (see below), the\npaper is well-written.\n\nGiven the popularity of Adam, I consider this paper to make a very\ninteresting observation. I further believe all issues with the technical\npresentation can be readily addressed.\n\n\n\nIssues with Technical Presentation:\n\n- All theorems should explicitly state the conditions they require\n  instead of referring to \"all the conditions in (Kingma & Ba, 2015)\".\n- Theorem 2 is a repetition of Theorem 1 (except for additional\n  conditions).\n- The proof of Theorem 3 assumes there are no projections, so this\n  should be stated as part of its conditions. (The claim in footnote 2\n  that they can be handled seems highly plausible, but you should be up\n  front about the limitations of your results.)\n- The regret bound Theorem 4 establishes convergence of the optimization\n  method, so it plays the role of a sanity check. However, it is\n  strictly worse than the regret bound O(sqrt{T}) for online gradient\n  descent [Zinkevich,2003], so it cannot explain why the proposed\n  AMSgrad method might be adaptive. (The method may indeed be adaptive\n  in some sense; I am just saying the *bound* does not express that.\n  This is also not a criticism of the current paper; the same remark\n  also applies to the previously claimed regret bound for Adam.)\n- The discussion following Corollary 1 suggests that sum_i\n  hat{v}_{T,i}^{1/2} might be much smaller than d G_infty. This is true,\n  but we should always expect it to be at least a constant, because\n  hat{v}_{t,i} is monotonically increasing by definition of the\n  algorithm, so the bound does not get better than O(sqrt(T)).\n  It is also suggested that sum_i ||g_{1:T,i}|| = sqrt{sum_{t=1}^T\n  g_{t,i}^2} might be much smaller than dG_infty, but this is very\n  unlikely, because this term will typically grow like O(sqrt{T}),\n  unless the data are extremely sparse, so we should at least expect\n  some dependence on T.\n- In the proof of Theorem 1, the initial point is taken to be x_1 = 1,\n  which is perfectly fine, but it is not \"without loss of generality\",\n  as claimed. This should be stated in the statement of the Theorem.\n- The proof of Theorem 6 in appendix B only covers epsilon=1. If it is\n  \"easy to show\" that the same construction also works for other\n  epsilon, as claimed, then please provide the proof for general\n  epsilon.\n\n\nOther remarks:\n\n- Theoretically, nonconvergence of Adam seems a severe problem. Can you\n  speculate on why this issue has not prevented its widespread adoption?\n  Which factors might mitigate the issue in practice?\n- Please define g_t \\circ g_t and g_{1:T,i}\n- I would recommend sticking with standard linear algebra notation for\n  the sqrt and the inverse of a matrix and simply using A^{-1} and\n  A^{1/2} instead of 1/A and sqrt{A}.\n- In theorems 1,2,3, I would recommend stating the dimension (d=1) of\n  your counterexamples, which makes them very nice!\n\nMinor issues:\n\n- Check accent on Nicol\\`o Cesa-Bianchi in bibliography.\n- Near the end of the proof of Theorem 6: I believe you mean Adam\n  suffers a \"regret\" instead of a \"loss\" of at least 2C-4.\n  Also 2C-4=2C-4 is trivial in the second but last display.\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"On the Convergence of Adam and Beyond","abstract":" Several recently proposed stochastic optimization methods that have been successfully used in training deep networks such as RMSProp, Adam, Adadelta, Nadam, etc are based on using gradient updates scaled by square roots of exponential moving averages of squared past gradients.

However, it has been proved that RMSProp with a certain settings of its parameters is nothing else than AdaGrad (see Section 4 in  Mukkamala and Hein, ICML'17). Hence, at least for a certain setting of its parameters, RMSProp will converge.

Indeed, all these variants of AdaGrad did not really improve the AdaGrad's regret bound. In this view, none of these algorithms contributed in any meaningful way to our understanding of the optimization of deep networks *nor* they advanced in any way the state-of-the-art for optimizing convex Lipschitz functions.\nOn the other hand, analysis of SGD-like algorithms with constant step sizes are known. See, for example, Zhang, ICML'04 where linear convergence is proved in a neighbourhood of the optimal solution for strongly convex problems.\nSo, even if I understand this is not the main objective of this paper, it would be nice to see a discussion on this point and the limitations of regret analysis to analyse SGD algorithms.\n\nOverall, I strongly suggest to accept this paper.\n\n\nSuggestions/minor things:\n- To facilitate the reader, I would state from the beginning what are the common settings of beta_1 and beta_2 in Adam. This makes easier to see that, for example, the condition of Theorem 2 is verified.\n- \\hat{v}_{0} is undefined in Algorithm 2.\n- The graphs in figure 2 would gain in readability if the setting of each one of them would be added as their titles.\n- McMahan and Streeter (2010) is missing the title.
