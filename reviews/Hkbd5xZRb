On a machine with 1 Titan X GPU, training the SHREC17 model takes about 50 hours, while the QM7 model takes only about 3 hours. Memory usage is 8GB for SHREC (batchsize 16) and 7GB for QM7 (batchsize 20).\n\nWe have studied the SHREC17 paper [1], but unfortunately it does not state the number of parameters or training time for the various methods. It does seem likely that each of the competition participants did their own cross validation, and arrived at an appropriate model complexity for their method. It is thus unlikely that the strong performance of our model relative to others can be explained by its size (especially since 1.4M parameters is not considered very large anymore).\n\nFor QM7, it looks like Montavon et al. used about 760k parameters (we have deduced this from the description of their network architecture). Since the model is a simple multi-layer perceptron applied to a hand-designed feature representation, we expect that it is substantially faster to train than our model (though indeed comparing a spherical CNN to an engineered features+MLP approach is a bit of an apples-to-oranges comparison). Raj et al. use a non-parametric method, so there is no parameter count or training time to compare to.\n\n[1] M. Savva et al.

(Unfortunately there is no space for a very long discussion)\n\nRE Convolution vs correlation: thank you for pointing this out. Our reasoning had been that:\n1) Everybody in deep learning uses the word \"convolution\" to mean \"cross-correlation\".\n2) In the non-commutative case, there are several different but essentially equivalent convolution-like integrals that one can define, with no really good reason to prefer one over the other.\n\nBut we did not explain this properly. We think a reasonable approach is to call something group convolution if, for the translation group it specializes to the standard convolution, and similarly for group correlations. This seems to be what several others before us have done as well, so we will follow this convention. Specifically, we will define the (group) cross-correlation as:\n  psi \\star f(g) = int psi(g^{-1} h) f(h) dh.\n\nRE The S^2CNN name: we have now defined this term in the introduction, but not changed it, because the paper is called \"Spherical CNN\" and S^2-CNN is just a shorthand for that name.\n\nRE Timings: we have added timings, memory usage numbers, and number of parameters to the paper.

However, a number of problems of recent interest have created a demand for models that can analyze spherical images. Examples include omnidirectional vision for drones, robots, and autonomous cars, molecular regression problems, and global weather and climate modelling. A naive application of convolutional networks to a planar projection of the spherical signal is destined to fail, because the space-varying distortions introduced by such a projection will make translational weight sharing ineffective.\n\nIn this paper we introduce the building blocks for contructing spherical CNNs. We propose a definition for the spherical cross-correlation that is both expressive and rotation-equivariant. The spherical correlation satisfies a generalized Fourier theorem, which allows us to compute it efficiently using a generalized (non-commutative) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.
