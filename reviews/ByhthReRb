For example, the experimental result on structured QA task (section 3.1), where it states that the performance different between models of With-NE-Table and W/O-NE-Table is positioned on the OOV NEs not present in the training subset. To my understanding, because of the presence of the NER in the With-NE-Table model, you could directly do update to the NE embeddings and query from the DB using a combination of embedding and the NE words (as the paper does), whereas the W/O-NE-Table model cannot because of lack of the NER. This seems to prove that an NER is useful for tasks where DB queries are needed, rather than that the dynamic NE-Table construction is useful. You could use an NER for W/O-NE-Table and update the NE embeddings, and it should be as good as With-NE-Table model (and fairer to compare with too).\"\n         It is totally true that NER is useful for these kind of tasks, and we utilise it. But just the NER alone is not enough. For example, in a dialog there could be multiple NEs of the same type occurring at different places and we need to choose the right one, say for a DB query. This can be done using the dynamic NE-table idea and it also a differentiable process and hence can be learnt using back propagation. Just identifying the NEs alone is not enough. \n        We do accept that for simple structured synthetic tasks such as the QA task of ours one could write a simple rule based system to utilise NER and do the task perfectly. Infact for the bAbI task, as shown in the original paper, one can build a rule based system (which are brittle ofcourse) to get 100% accuracy on all tasks, since the data is a synthetic simulated one, but this is not true for real data. For more sophisticated tasks, where it's not possible to solve the task by writing a set of rules, our approach for handling named entities provides a first of its kind solution and addresses problems associated with learning embeddings for rare NEs and handling OOV NEs. It also gives a way to work with exact NE values, within the neural learning framework.\n         Also, for all our dialog tasks in the bAbI dialog dataset, we do give the NE type information to the baseline W/O-NE table model as well.\n\nR:\"It would be better if the paper could point out the importance of NER for user utterances, and the fact that using the knowledge of which words are NEs in dialogue models could help in tasks where DB queries are necessary.\"\n        We totally agree with this point and we have added this to our updated version of the paper.\n\n "},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"A Neural Method for Goal-Oriented Dialog Systems to interact with Named Entities","abstract":"Many goal-oriented dialog tasks, especially ones in which the dialog system has to interact with external knowledge sources such as databases, have to handle a large number of Named Entities (NEs).

We have tried to split the core idea from the retrieval mechanism used in the experiments in the text and have explained the retrieval mechanism separately in section 3.1\n\nR:\"1. How are the keys generated? That are the functions used? Does the \"knowledge of the current user utterance\" include the word itself?\"\n    When using an RNN sentence encoder, the exact mechanism for generating an embedding for a NE is shown in equation 1 in section 2. It is also shown in figure 1. In words, when the encoder RNN encounters a NE, the representation of the dialog so far, the sentence representation of the current user utterance so far and the NE type information are used (a linear transformation) to generate a neural embedding on the fly and is stored in the NE-Table as key along with the NE associated with it stored as the value. \nThe knowledge of the current NE word is given by its NE-type.\n\nR:\"2. According to the description, referring to an existing named entity must be done by \"generating a key to match the keys in the NE table and then retrieve the corresponding value and use it\". Is there a guarantee that a same named entity, appearing later in the dialog, will be given the same key?  Or are the keys for already found entities retrieved directly, by value?\"\n    A new key is generated for each named entity that comes during a dialog, irrespective of whether they have occurred before in the dialog (hence already in the NE table) or not.  \n\nR:\"3. In the decoding phase, how does the system decide whether to query the DB?\"\n    The system has to make a decision whether it has to query the DB or not. The exact way and place where this is done is task dependent. For example, in the QA task, query to the DB happens always. In the case of the bAbI dialog task 1 and 2, query to the DB happens only if the agent chooses to output the “api_call’’ sentence. In dialog task 4, the DB query happens whenever the output system utterance has a NE_tag as a part of it (hence requires some information from the DB).\n\nR:\"4. How is the model trained?\"\n    In all our experiments the model is trained in a fully supervised way, along with the labels for column and row attentions (for the DB retrieval mechanism).\n\nR:\"In its current form, it's not clear how the proposed approach tackles the shortcomings mentioned in the introduction. Furthermore, while the highlighted contribution is the named entity table, it is always used in conjunction to the database approach. This raises the question whether the named entity table can only work in this context.\"\n    We have a method that can learn to store and point to any NE that has occurred in the dialog so far, depending upon the requirement of the downstream task. This gives neural way of interacting with NEs that does not have the following issues: Explosion in vocabulary size, issues associated with not learning good embeddings as a particular NE occurs only few times in a dataset, loss of information and inability to refer to particular NEs of the same type, which happens when NEs are replaced by their NE type tags, issues with OOV NE words. The idea is general enough to be applied in any NLP task that involves NEs. Here we focus on goal-oriented dialog, which almost always has an external DB and has the set of issues mentioned above. We are working on experiments which don't involve a DB and will share more details on future work.\n\nR:\"For the structured QA task, there are 400 training examples, and 100 named entities. This means that the number of training examples per named entity is very small. Is that correct? If yes, then it's not very surprising that adding the named entities to the vocabulary leads to overfitting. Have you compared with using random embeddings for the named entities?\"\n     NEs in general have this issue of not being able to learn good neural embeddings for them since the individual NEs occur only few number of times in a dataset. As you have pointed out, that is very much true here as well. Here the whole dataset dominated by lot of NEs, but the training examples per NE is similar to a real world scenario.\nThe point that we were trying to emphasize was about the new NEs that come during the test time in the questions, which the system has not seen in the questions during the training time. The embeddings of these new NEs that come during the test time alone, have not been trained and hence remain random as they were initialised. In a general task, this might be confusing to a system that tries to interpret or work with their embeddings. Following your suggestion, we did an experiment (Structured QA task) with random embeddings for NEs and fixing it throughout, the test performance (accuracy) is still 82 %, compared to the 100% accuracy which we obtain using the NE-table idea."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"A Neural Method for Goal-Oriented Dialog Systems to interact with Named Entities","abstract":"Many goal-oriented dialog tasks, especially ones in which the dialog system has to interact with external knowledge sources such as databases, have to handle a large number of Named Entities (NEs).

In words, when the encoder RNN encounters a NE, the representation of the dialog so far (h^d_t−1 ), the sentence representation of the current user utterance so far (h^x,enc_t,i−1 ) and the NE type information are used (a linear transformation) to generate a neural embedding (z^ne_i ) on the fly and is stored in the NE-Table as key along with the NE x_t,i associated with it stored as the value.\n\nR: \"Is it correct that the same representation stored in the NE table is used twice?

For example, the experimental result on structured QA task (section 3.1), where it states that the performance different between models of With-NE-Table and W/O-NE-Table is positioned on the OOV NEs not present in the training subset. To my understanding, because of the presence of the NER in the With-NE-Table model, you could directly do update to the NE embeddings and query from the DB using a combination of embedding and the NE words (as the paper does), whereas the W/O-NE-Table model cannot because of lack of the NER. This seems to prove that an NER is useful for tasks where DB queries are needed, rather than that the dynamic NE-Table construction is useful. You could use an NER for W/O-NE-Table and update the NE embeddings, and it should be as good as With-NE-Table model (and fairer to compare with too).\n\nThat said, overall the paper is a nice contribution to dialogue and QA system research by pointing out a simple way of handling named entities by dynamically updating their embeddings.

In this paper, we propose a new neural method for this problem, and present empirical evaluations on a structured Question answering task and three related goal-oriented dialog tasks that show that our proposed method can be effective in interacting with NEs in these settings.","pdf":"/pdf/afccb8cf8ffbd2f9242fe0a67559cf72fe106b41.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|a_neural_method_for_goaloriented_dialog_systems_to_interact_with_named_entities","_bibtex":"@article{\n  anonymous2018a,\n  title={A Neural Method for Goal-Oriented Dialog Systems to interact with Named Entities},\n  author={Anonymous},\n  journal={International Conference on Learning Representations},\n  year={2018},\n  url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByhthReRb}\n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper466/Authors"],"keywords":["Named Entities","Neural methods","Goal oriented dialog"]}},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1515198681214,"tcdate":1509121156326,"number":466,"cdate":1509739285465,"id":"ByhthReRb","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"ByhthReRb","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"A Neural Method for Goal-Oriented Dialog Systems to interact with Named Entities","abstract":"Many goal-oriented dialog tasks, especially ones in which the dialog system has to interact with external knowledge sources such as databases, have to handle a large number of Named Entities (NEs).
