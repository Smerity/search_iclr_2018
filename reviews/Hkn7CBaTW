Instead it defines a different, bayesian, measure on importance. The visualisations are therefore not directly comparable.  The work by Zintgraf is excellent and we have included a comparison for the qualitative visualisation in the appendix.\n\n\n\n\nQuote:\n* Fig 3: Why is the random method so good at removing correlation from fc6? And the S_w even better? Something seems special about fc6.\n\nAnswer:\nThe weight vector always has a dot product of 1 with the informative direction. They do not coincide but they are correlated. Therefore it is to be expected that S_w performs better than the random direction. The fc_6 result is indeed surprising. It is the first fully connected layer and has therefore the largest dimensionality in the input. This makes measuring the quality of the signal estimators more difficult in this layer.  \n\n\n\n\nQuote:\n* Fig 4: Why is the identical estimator better than the weights estimator and that one better than S_a?\n\nAnswer:\nThe degradation experiment favors the identity estimator since LRP(=identity estimator) reduces to gradient x input. If the gradient would be constant (as it is in a linear model) the biggest change you can create in the logit by changing a single dimension.That the linear pattern does not work as well as the two-component version can be attributed to the fact that it incorrectly models the signal component by ignoring nonlinear component introduced by the ReLu.\n\n\n\n\nQuote:\n* It would be nice to compare the image degradation experiment with using the ranking provided by the work from Zintgraf which should by definition function as a kind of gold standard\n\nAnswer:\nIt would be interesting but not feasible unfortunately. The work by Zintgraf et al takes for VGG 70 minutes per image (according to their paper). Processing each of the 50.000 validation images already takes 50.000 images  * 70 min /60 (min) /24 (hours) = 2430 days of compute. Since we have to process each image multiple times times this is simply not possible.\n\n\n\n\nQuote:\n* Figure 5, 4th row (mailbox): It looks like the umbrella significantly contributes to the network decision to classify the image as \"mailbox\" which doesn't make too much sense. Is is a problem of the visualization  (maybe there is next to no weight on the umbrella), of PatternAttribution or a strange but interesting a artifact of the analyzed network?\n\nAnswer:\nWe have no definitive explanation yet. A possible explanation is that the second to last layer has to contain information on all the classes. Umbrella is one of these classes. Also in the explanation of the Zintgraf method the umbrella contributes positively to the mailbox class. This is an indication that it could be an artifact of the analyzed network.\n\n\n\n\nQuote:\n* page 8 \"... closed form solutions (Eq (4) and Eq. (7))\" The first reference seems to be wrong. I guess Eq 4. should instead reference the unnumbered equation after Eq. 3.\n\nAnswer:\nThanks: we will update the manuscript.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Learning how to explain neural networks: PatternNet and PatternAttribution","abstract":"DeConvNet, Guided BackProp, LRP, were invented to better understand deep neural networks.

At present the \"state of the art\" discussion appears quite narrow, being confined to recent methods for visualization of discriminative deep models.\n\nAnswer:\nWe intentionally kept the scope of the state of the art focussed on the methods for discriminative models. We motivate this choice as follows: our analysis focuses on these methods that analyse discriminative models. The goal of the interpretability methods is to find what the informative component is in the data. The general field of generative modelling on the other hand tries to model the full data, both the informative and non-informative components. \nWe refrained from directly comparing to the greater framework of generative models in deep learning because we wanted to prevent confusion among the readers and to limit the length of the manuscript. That being said, we do believe that these models (GAN’s, VAE, …) can become part of methods for interpretability, e.g. they could be used for signal estimation. \n\n\n\n\nQuote:\nThe authors convincingly demonstrate for the linear case, that their \"PatternNet\" mechanism can produce the generative process (i.e. discard spatially correlated \"distractors\"). The PatternNet is generalized to multi-layer ReLu networks by construction of node-specific pattern vectors and back-propagating these through the network. The \"proof\" (eqs. 4-6) is sketchy and involves uncontrolled approximations. The back-propagation mechanism is very briefly introduced and depicted in figure 1.\n\nAnswer:\nTo obtain PatternNet, we started by maximizing equation 1. \nThis equation describes that we want to remove the signal from the input.\nThe signal being the component in the input that is predictive (linearly) about the output of the neuron. \nIn Equation 2, we show that this can be done by ensuring that the covariance between the signal and the output is identical to the covariance between the original input and the output. This is shown generally without making additional assumptions on the signal.\n\nHowever, to turn Eq. 2 into an actionable approach, we must make an assumption on the functional form of the signal estimator.  This is what we do in Eq. 3 for the linear case and Eq. 4 for the non-linear case. \nOn the other hand, Equations 5 and 6 are simply re-writing the covariance. There is no additional approximation. \nThe step to Eq. 7 introduces a new assumption. Here we assume that the contribution to the covariances for 5 and 6 are equal in the non-firing regime are equal. The same holds for the firing (activation above 0) regime. Since this is an approximation, we carefully designed our experiments (including the one in Fig. 3) to measure the quality of this approximation.\n\nWe do agree with the reviewer that it would be extremely valuable to create a formal proof that this is the optimal approach. However, so far we did not find a way to create this proof. Furthermore, we are not aware of any formal approach within the field of interpretability that is able to do this. Instead, we have to rely on the evidence that (1) our approach can solve the linear toy problem correctly and (2) our experimental results indicate that it is a quantitative and qualitative improvement over previous methods. \nTo clarify the back-propagation mechanism we updated the manuscript with an appendix making the algorithms explicit.\n\n\n\n\nQuote:\nYet, the results are rather convincing.

The attribution of output values to input dimensions shows how much an individual component of the signal contributes to the output…” (p. 5). The authors propose a novel quality criterion for signal estimators, inspired by the analysis of linear models. They also propose two new explanatory methods, PatternNet (for signal estimation) and PatternAttribution (for relevance attribution), based on optimizing their new quality criterion. They present quantitative and qualitative analyses comparing PatternNet and PatternAttribution to several existing explanation methods on VGG-19.\n\n* Quality: The claims of the paper are well supported by quantitative results and qualitative visualizations. \n* Clarity: Overall the paper is clear and well organized. There are a few points that could benefit from clarification.\n* Originality: The paper puts forth an original framing of the problem of explaining deep neural networks. Related work is appropriately cited and compared. The authors's quality criterion for signal estimators allows them to do a quantitative analysis for a problem that is often hard to quantify.\n* Significance: This paper justifies PatternNet and PatternAttribution as good methods to explain predictions made by neural networks. These methods may now serve as an important tool for future work which may lead to new insights about how neural networks work. \n\nPros:\n* Helps to organize existing methods for understanding neural networks in terms of the types of descriptions they provide: functions, signals or attribution.\n* Creative quantitative analyses that evaluate their signal estimator at the level of single units and entire networks.\n\nCons:\n* Experiments consider only the pre-trained VGG-19 model trained on ImageNet. Results may not generalize to other architectures/datasets.\n* Limited visualizations are provided. \n\nComments:\n* Most of the paper is dedicated to explaining these signal estimators and quality criterion in case of a linear model.

One would like to see that the signal estimation is doing more than separating foreground from background but is actually semantically specific. For instance, for the mailbox image, what does the signal look like if you propagate back from only the output unit for umbrella compared to the output unit for mailbox? \n* Do you have any intuition about why your two-component estimator doesn’t seem to be working as well in the convolutional layers? Do you think it is related to the fact that you are averaging within feature maps? Is it strictly necessary to do this averaging?

The contribution made by the authors stands out due to its elegant combination of theoretical insights and improved performance in application. The work is very detailed and reads very well.\n\nI am missing at least one figure with comparison with more state-of-the-art methods (e.g. I would love to see results from the method by Zintgraf et al. 2017 which unlike all included prior methods seems to produce much crisper visualizations and also is very related because it learns from the data, too).\n\nMinor questions and comments:\n* Fig 3: Why is the random method so good at removing correlation from fc6? And the S_w even better? Something seems special about fc6.\n* Fig 4: Why is the identical estimator better than the weights estimator and that one better than S_a?\n* It would be nice to compare the image degradation experiment with using the ranking provided by the work from Zintgraf which should by definition function as a kind of gold standard\n* Figure 5, 4th row (mailbox): It looks like the umbrella significantly contributes to the network decision to classify the image as \"mailbox\" which doesn't make too much sense. Is is a problem of the visualization  (maybe there is next to no weight on the umbrella), of PatternAttribution or a strange but interesting a artifact of the analyzed network?\n* page 8 \"... closed form solutions (Eq (4) and Eq. (7))\" The first reference seems to be wrong. I guess Eq 4. should instead reference the unnumbered equation after Eq. 3.\n\nUpdate 2018-01-12: Upgraded Rating from 7 to 8 (see comment below)","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Learning how to explain neural networks: PatternNet and PatternAttribution","abstract":"DeConvNet, Guided BackProp, LRP, were invented to better understand deep neural networks.
