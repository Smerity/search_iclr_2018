A better explanation on this (and similarly for say infoGAN/infoVAE) will significantly improve the paper. Continuing on the above point, why in section 4 you turn to discuss relationship between mutual information and test-LL?  How does that relate to the main point you want to present in the paper, which is to prefer MI interpretation if I understand it correctly?“\n\nOur view (optimize mutual information under distribution matching constraint) provides several understandings traditional perspectives do not provide. First, several attributes of an objective are revealed by the Lagrangian form: information preference, possible optimization methods (likelihood based or likelihood free), closure (most generic form) of model family, etc. In addition Section 4 proceeds to demonstrate two applications where the Lagrangian perspective reveal problems/features that are difficult to identify from traditional perspectives.  \n\n\n1.Correct optimization of the Lagrangian dual requires maximization over the Lagrangian parameters. However, all existing methods use fixed (arbitrarily chosen) Lagrangian parameters. We show failure cases where this does not correctly optimize the primal problem. For example, when the primal objective is information maximization under constraints of distributional consistency, optimization with fixed Lagrangian parameters can maximize mutual information indefinitely without ever encouraging distributional consistency. As a result, data fit (distributional consistency) may even get worse during training (for example, resulting in lower test log likelihood) as mutual information is maximized. We show that this also happens in practice. \n\n2.The Lagrangian perspective allows us to explicitly weight (“price”) different (conflicting) terms in the objective. For example, suppose the input x has more dimensions than the feature space z. Then for the same per-dimension loss, the input space is weighted more than the latent space (because it has more dimensions). We show in the paper that increasing the weight on matching marginals on z can solve the problem and leads to better performance. In general, we can write out the desired preference in Lagrangian form, and then convert it into a familiar model and optimization method (in our example, this corresponds to InfoVAE with a specific hyper-parameter choice.)\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"The Information-Autoencoding Family: A Lagrangian Perspective on Latent Variable Generative Modeling","abstract":"A variety of learning objectives have been recently proposed for training generative models.

We are able to characterize **all** learning objectives that can be optimized under given computational constraints (likelihood based optimization; unary likelihood free optimization; binary likelihood free optimization) providing a “closure” result. Even though we do not introduce a new learning objective, we show that (slightly generalized versions) of ten (already known) “base classes” encompass all possible objectives in each category. Therefore, in a certain sense, we show that there do not exist “new” objectives under our stated assumptions on how objectives can be constructed. \n\n2. We show that several known problems are revealed by the Lagrangian perspective and hold across the entire model family: \n\na.

In general, we can write out the desired preference in Lagrangian form, and then convert it into a familiar model and optimization method (in our example, this corresponds to InfoVAE with a specific hyper-parameter choice.)\n\n“What is the importance of T1, T2, and T3 classes defined in Def. 7, i.e., why are these classes useful in solving some problems?”\n\nIt has been observed experimentally that T1 T2 and T3 are increasingly more challenging in terms of optimization stability, sensitivity to hyper-parameters, and outcome of optimization (Arjovsky et al., 2017). In particular, T1 (likelihood based, e.g. VAE) is highly stable and converges quickly, while T2/T3 methods (such as GANs) suffer from issues such as optimization stability, non-convergence. T3 is slightly more challenging than T2 because BiGAN/ALI (Dumoulin et al., 2016a; Donahue et al., 2016) tend to suffer from inaccurate inference. \n\n“Is the opposite relationship in Theorem 1, 2, and 3 true as well, e.g., is every linear combination of beta-ELBO and VMI is equivalent to a likelihood-based computable-objective of KL info-encoding family? Is the same true for other theorems?”\n\n\nYes the opposite relationship is true as well. The existing objectives enumerated in Theorem 1, 2, 3 are exactly equivalent to T1/T2/T3 computably objectives respectively.\n\n“Third, the objective of section 3 is to show that only some choices of lambda lead to a dual with a tractable equivalent form. Could you rewrite the theorems so that they truly reflect this, rather than stating something which only indirectly imply the main claim of the paper.”\n\nThe statement we supported with Theorems 1/2/3 is: only some parameters choices lead to objectives in each computability (T1/T2/T3) classes (easy vs hard to optimize). For example, only parameters choices that correspond to beta-VAE/VMI can have a likelihood-based computable equivalent form. Most objectives cannot be equivalently transformed to become a likelihood based computable objective. We have revised the paper to make the statement more clear. \n\n“Some small comments”\n\nThank you. We have revised the writing according to the advice. \n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"The Information-Autoencoding Family: A Lagrangian Perspective on Latent Variable Generative Modeling","abstract":"A variety of learning objectives have been recently proposed for training generative models.

They describe tradeoffs between flexibility and computation in this objective leading to different approaches. Unfortunately, I'm not sure what specific contributions come out, and the paper seems to meander in derivations and remarks that I didn't understand what the point was.\n\nFirst, it's not clear what this proposed generalization offers. It's a very nuanced and not insightful construction (eq. 3) and with a specific choice of a weighted sum of mutual informations subject to a combinatorial number of divergence measure constraints, each possibly held in expectation (eq. 5) to satisfy the chosen subclass of VAEs and GANs; and with or without likelihoods (eq. 7).

The stated usefulness of the method unfortunately do not answer my worry about the significance. It remains unclear to me how much \"real\" difference the presented results would make to advance the existing work on generative models. Also, the authors did not promised any major changes in the final version in this direction, which is why I have reduced my score.\n\nI do believe that this work could be useful and should be resubmitted. There are two main things to improve. First, the paper need more work on improving the clarity. Second, more work needs to be added to show that the paper will make a real difference to advance/improve existing methods.\n\n==========\nBefore rebuttal\n==========\nThis paper proposes an optimization problem whose Lagrangian duals contain many existing objective functions for generative models. Using this framework, the paper tries to generalize the optimization problems by defining computationally-tractable family which can be expressed in terms of existing objective functions. \n\nThe paper has interesting elements and the results are original. The main issue is that the significance is unclear. The writing in Section 3 is unclear for me, which further made it challenging to understand the consequences of the theorems presented in that section. \n\nHere is a big-picture question that I would like to know answer for. Do the results of sec 3 help us identify a more useful/computationally tractable model than exiting approaches? Clarification on this will help me evaluate the significance of the paper.\n\nI have three main clarification points. First, what is the importance of T1, T2, and T3 classes defined in Def. 7, i.e., why are these classes useful in solving some problems? Second, is the opposite relationship in Theorem 1, 2, and 3 true as well, e.g., is every linear combination of beta-ELBO and VMI is equivalent to a likelihood-based computable-objective of KL info-encoding family? Is the same true for other theorems?\n\nThird, the objective of section 3 is to show that \"only some choices of lambda lead to a dual with a tractable equivalent form\". Could you rewrite the theorems so that they truly reflect this, rather than stating something which only indirectly imply the main claim of the paper.\n\nSome small comments:\n- Eq. 4. It might help to define MI to remind readers.\n- After Eq. 7, please add a proof (may be in the Appendix). It is not that straightforward to see this. Also, I suppose you are saying Eq. 3 but with f from Eq. 4.\n- Line after Eq. 8, D_i is \"one\" of the following... Is it always the same D_i for all i or it could be different? Make this more clear to avoid confusion.\n- Last line in Para after Eq. 15, \"This neutrality corresponds to the observations made in..\" It might be useful to add a line explaining that particular \"observation\"\n- Def. 7, the names did not make much sense to me. You can add a line explaining why this name is chosen.\n- Def. 8, the last equation is unclear. Does the first equivalence impy the next one? \n- Writing in Sec. 3.3 can be improved. e.g., \"all linear operations on log prob.\" is very unclear, \"stated computational constraints\" which constraints?\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"The Information-Autoencoding Family: A Lagrangian Perspective on Latent Variable Generative Modeling","abstract":"A variety of learning objectives have been recently proposed for training generative models.

For example in VAE case, why this mutual information view is better than the traditional view of approximate MLE, where q is known to be the approximate posterior? A better explanation on this (and similarly for say infoGAN/infoVAE) will significantly improve the paper.\n\nContinuing on the above point, why in section 4 you turn to discuss relationship between mutual information and test-LL?  How does that relate to the main point you want to present in the paper, which is to prefer MI interpretation if I understand it correctly?\n\nTerm usage: we usually *maximize* the ELBO and *minimise* the variational free-energy (VFE).
