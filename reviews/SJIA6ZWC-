The core idea is to have a side neural network sufficiently expressive to learn the (large-scale, matrix-valued) mapping from a given configuration of hyper-parameters to the weights of the model we wish to tune.\nThe paper gives a theoretical justification of its approach, and then describes several variants of its core algorithm which mix the training of the hyper-networks together with the optimization of the hyper-parameters themselves. Finally, experiments based on MNIST illustrate the properties of the proposed approach.\n\nWhile the core idea may appear as appealing, the paper suffers from several flaws (as further detailed afterwards):\n-Insufficient related work\n-Correctness/rigor of Theorem 2.1\n-Clarity of the paper (e.g., Sec. 2.4)\n-Experiments look somewhat artificial\n-How scalable is the proposed approach in the perspective of tuning models way larger/more complex than those treated in the experiments?\n\n*Detailed comments*\n\n-\"...and training the model to completion.\" and \"This is wasteful, since it trains the model from scratch each time...\" (and similar statement in Sec. 2.1): Those statements are quite debatable. There are lines of work, e.g., in Bayesian optimization, to model early stopping/learning curves (e.g., Domhan2014, Klein2017 and references therein) and where training procedures are explicitly resumed (e.g., Swersky2014, Li2016). The paper should reformulate its statements in the light of this literature.\n\n-\"Uncertainty could conceivably be incorporated into the hypernet...\". This seems indeed an important point, but it does not appear as clear how to proceed (e.g., uncertainty on w_phi(lambda) which later needs to propagated to L_val); could the authors perhaps further elaborate?\n\n-I am concerned about the rigor/correctness of Theorem 2.1; for instance, how is the continuity of the best-response exploited? Also, throughout the paper, the argmin is defined as if it was a singleton while in practice it is rather a set-valued mapping (except if there is a unique minimizer for L_train(., lambda), which is unlikely to be the case given the nature of the considered neural-net model). In the same vein, Jensen's inequality states that Expectation[g(X)] >= g(Expectation[X]) for some convex function g and random variable X; how does it precisely translate into the paper's setting (convexity, which function g, etc.)? \n\n-Specify in Alg. 1 that \"hyperopt\" refers to a generic hyper-parameter procedure.\n\n-More details should be provided to better understand Sec. 2.4. At the moment, it is difficult to figure out (and potentially reproduce) the model which is proposed.\n\n-The training procedure in Sec. 4.2 seems quite ad hoc; how sensitive was the overall performance with respect to the optimization strategy? For instance, in 4.2 and 4.3, different optimization parameters are chosen.\n\n-typo: \"weight decay is applied the...\" --> \"weight decay is applied to the...\"\n\n-\"a standard Bayesian optimization implementation from sklearn\": Could more details be provided? (there does not seem to be implementation there http://scikit-learn.org/stable/model_selection.html to the best of my knowledge)\n\n-The experimental set up looks a bit far-fetched and unrealistic: first scalar, than diagonal and finally matrix-weighted regularization schemes. While the first two may be used in practice, the third scheme is not used in practice to the best of my knowledge.\n\n-typo: \"fit a hypernet same dataset.\" --> \"fit a hypernet on the same dataset.\"\n\n-(Franceschi2017) could be added to the related work section.\n\n*References*\n\n(Domhan2014) Domhan, T.; Springenberg, T. & Hutter, F.

A hyper-network is a network that has been trained to find optimal weights for another neural network on a particular learning task. This hyper-network can also be trained using gradient descent, and then can be optimized with respect to its inputs (hyper-parameters) to find optimal hyper-parameters. Of course, for this to be feasible training the hyper-network has to be efficient. For this, the authors suggest to use a linear hyper-network. The use of this approach for hyper-parameter optimization is illustrated in several experiments considering a linear model on the MNIST dataset.\n\nThe paper is clearly written with only a few typing errors.\n\nAs far as I know this work is original. This is the first time that hyper-networks are used for hyper-parameter optimization.\n\nThe significance of the work can, however, be questioned. To begin with, the models considered by the authors are rather small. They are simply linear models in which the number of weights is not very big. In particular, only 7,850 weights. The corresponding hyper-net has around 15,000, which is twice as big. Furthermore, the authors say that they train the hyper-network 10 times more than standard gradient descent on the hyper-parameter. This accounts for training the original model 20 times more. \n\nIf the original model is a deep neural network with several hidden layers and several hidden units in each layer, it is not clear if the proposed approach will be feasible. That is my main concern with this paper. The lack of representative models such as the ones used in practical applications.\n\nAnother limitation is that the proposed approach seems to be limited to neural network models. The other techniques the authors compare with are more general and can optimize the hyper-parameters of other models.\n\nSomething strange is that the authors claim in Figure 6 that the proposed method is able to optimize 7,850 hyper-parameters. However, it is not clear to what extent this is true. To begin with, it seems that the performance obtained is worse than with 10 hyper-parameters (shown on the right). Since the left case is a general case of the right case (having only 10 hyper-parameters different) it is strange that worse results are obtained in the left case. It seems that the optimization process is reaching sub-optimal solutions.\n\nThe experiments shown in Figure 7 are strange. I have not fully understood their importance or what conclusions can the authors extract from them.\n\nI have also missed comparing with related techniques such as Dougal Maclaurin et al., 2015.\n\nSumming up, this seems to be an interesting paper proposing an interesting idea. However, it seems the practical utility of the method described is limited to small models only, which questions the overall significance.\n\n","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Stochastic Hyperparameter Optimization through Hypernetworks","abstract":"Machine learning models are usually tuned by nesting optimization of model weights inside the optimization of hyperparameters.
