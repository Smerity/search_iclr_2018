Built upon a popular segmentation network, the paper integrated adversarial loss to incorporate unlabeled examples in training. The outputs from the discriminator are interpreted as indicators for the reliability of label prediction, and used to filter-out non-reliable predictions as augmented training data from unlabeled images.  The proposed method achieved consistent improvement over existing state-of-the-art on two challenging segmentation datasets.\n\nAlthough the motivation is reasonable and the results are impressive, there are some parts that need more clarification/discussion as described below.\n\n1) Robustness of discriminator output:\nThe main contribution of the proposed model is exploiting the outputs from the discriminator as the confidence score maps of the predicted segmentation labels. However, the outputs from the discriminator indicate whether its inputs are from ground-truth labels or model predictions, and may not be directly related to ‘correctness’ of the label prediction. For instance, it may prefer per-pixel score vectors closed to one-hot encoded vectors. More thorough analysis/discussions are required to show how outputs from discriminator are correlated with the correctness of label prediction.     \n\n2) Design of discriminator\nI wonder if conditional discriminator fits better for the task. i.e. D(X,P) instead of D(P). It may prevent the model generating label prediction P non-relevant to input X by adversarial training, and makes the score prediction from the discriminator more meaningful. Some ablation study or discussions would be helpful.\n\n3) Presentations\nThere are several abused notations; notations for the ground-truth label P and the prediction from the generator S(X) should be clearly separated in Eq. (1) and (4). Also, it would better to find a better notation for the outputs from D instead of D^(*,0) and D^(*,1).  \nTraining details in semi-supervised learning would be helpful. For instance, the proposed semi-supervised learning strategy based on Eq. (5) may be suffered by noise outputs from the discriminator in early training stages. I wonder how authors resolved the issues (e.g. training the generator and discriminator are with the labeled example first and extending it to training with unlabeled data.) \n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Adversarial Learning for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation","abstract":"We propose a method for semi-supervised semantic segmentation using the adversarial network.

There are two key ideas:\n\n- Attach a pixel-level GAN loss to the output semantic segmentation map. That is, add a discriminator network that decides whether each pixel in the label map belongs to a real label map or not. Of course, this loss alone is unaware of the input image and would drive the network to produce plausible label maps that have no relation to the input image. An additional cross-entropy loss (the standard semantic segmentation loss) is used to tie the network to the input and the ground-truth label map, when available.\n\n- Additional unlabeled data is utilized by using a trained semantic segmentation network to produce a label map with associated confidences; high-confidence pixels are used as ground-truth labels and are fed back to the network as training data.\n\nThe paper is fine and the work is competently done, but the experimental results never quite come together. The technical development isn’t surprising and doesn’t have much to teach researchers working in the area. Given that the technical novelty is rather light and the experimental benefits are not quite there, I cannot recommend the paper for publication in a first-tier conference.\n\nSome more detailed comments:\n\n1. The GAN and the semi-supervised training scheme appear to be largely independent. The GAN can be applied without any unlabeled data, for example. The paper generally appears to present two largely independent ideas. This is fine, except they don’t convincingly pan out in experiments.\n\n2. The biggest issue is that the experimental results do not convincingly indicate that the presented ideas are useful.\n2a. In the “Full” condition, the presented approach does not come close to the performance of the DeepLab baseline, even though the DeepLab network is used in the presented approach. Perhaps the authors have taken out some components of the DeepLab scheme for these experiments, such as multi-scale processing, but the question then is “Why?”. These components are not illegal, they are not cheating, they are not overly complex and are widely used. If the authors cannot demonstrate an improvement with these components, their ideas are unlikely to be adopted in state-of-the-art semantic systems, which do use these components and are doing fine.\n2b. In the 1/8, 1/4, and 1/2 conditions, the performance of the baselines is not quoted. This is wrong. Since the authors are evaluating on the validation sets, there is no reason not to train the baselines on the same amount of labeled data (1/8, 1/4, 1/2) and report the results. The training scripts are widely available and such training of baselines for controlled experiments is commonly done in the literature. The reviewer is left to suspect, with no evidence given to the contrary, that the presented approach does not outperform the DeepLab baseline even in the reduced-data conditions.\n\nA somewhat unflattering view of the work would be that this is another example of throwing a GAN at everything to see if it sticks. In this case, the experiments do not indicate that it did.","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Adversarial Learning for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation","abstract":"We propose a method for semi-supervised semantic segmentation using the adversarial network.

Here are some details that can help yo reproduce our baseline:\n\n1. Upsampling module: We use 2D bilinear upsampling in our segmentation model (essentially nn.upsample in PyTorch). We use one upsampling module with 8x instead of using three 2x layers. In your case, it would be equivalent to 3 ConvTranspose2D layers with their coefficients initialized as the bilinear kernel with zero learning rate. Intuitively, having upsampling layers with learnable parameters might have better performance due to larger model capacity. But in both our experiments and the original FCN paper from Long et al., learning upsampling does not show significant improvement but introduce much computational overhead in training process.\n\n2. As mentioned in the paper, we use the Resnet-101 model that is pretrained on the ImageNet. We use the mean and variance for data normalization as the same during pretraining. If you choose to use the torchvision models from PyTorch, the standard data processing transforms are listed in their official docs.\n\nWe wish the information can help you in your experiments. Let us know if you encounter any issue.

I was trying to reproduce the results of your submission as part of the Reproducibility Challenge. For the baseline model, I have achieved a 52 % mIoU so far. I would like to clarify a few details that might be helpful in replicating the results:\n\n1> What method have you used during the training for upsampling the output map of the DeepLab-v2 network to size 321x321 (input image size for training in PASCALVOC). Currently, I have 3 ConvTranspose2D layers (corresponding to each downsampling layer in the DeepLap-v2 network), each upsampling by a factor of 2. \n\n2> Did you use any other common data preprocessing (like Normalization to 0 mean and 1 variance) ?\n\nIs there any other significant detail that would be helpful in improving the results to match those in the paper?\n\nThanks again for your work.
