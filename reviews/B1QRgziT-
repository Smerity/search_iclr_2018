As we explain in the experiment section, we are using the modified generator updated rule proposed by Goodfellow et al (2014), which uses softplus function -log sigmoid(f(x)) = log  (1 + exp(-f(x))) := softplus(-f(x)) in place of log (1- sigmoid(f(x))) so that one can maintain the learning process.  Note that softplus(-f(x)) is approximately -f(x)  when f(x) < 0 (In fact, on the bulk of the support of the generator,  f(x) tends to be negative. ). Thus, the generator will be looking at the gradient of f(x) on the course of its training.  As such, we need to keep our eyes on the gradient of f(x), which can blow up outside of the support of p or q (see Eq (4) ) without any gradient regularization as a countermeasure. \nSo far, this is our current postulate on the importance of Lipschitz constant in GAN. The gest of our paper is that, WGAN-GP and our spectral normalization can constrain the norm of the gradient so that this will not be a problem. \n \nAlso, we shall make it clear that our method is not designed specifically for the purpose of preventing mode-collapse.  However, it is not hard to imagine that the control of the Lipschitz constant of the discriminator would prevent the training process of the generator to plateau prematurely because of the critical gradient problem we have described above.  \n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Spectral Normalization for Generative Adversarial Networks","abstract":"One of the challenges in the study of generative adversarial networks is the instability of its training. \nIn this paper, we propose a novel weight normalization technique called spectral normalization to stabilize the training of the discriminator.\nOur new normalization technique is computationally light and easy to incorporate into existing implementations. \nWe tested the efficacy of spectral normalization on CIFAR10, STL-10, and ILSVRC2012 dataset, and we experimentally confirmed that spectrally normalized GANs (SN-GANs) is capable of generating images of better or equal quality relative to the previous training stabilization techniques.

For WGAN, the Lipschitz constraint is required due to the Wasserstein divergence metric. However, for the original GAN, I am not clear why the Lipschitz constraint is so helpful. According to my knowledge, one source of mode collapse is that the generated probability at some data points is very small (almost zero) and D(x) is locally constant (equal to 0) around those data points. Then the gradient of D(x) at those data points is zero, which prevents the update of the generator.

Our stance on this matter is that, mathematically, spectral normalization and orthonormality constraints are quite different, because the orthonormality constraint destroys the information about the spectrum by setting all the singular values to one.  On the other hand, spectral normalization only scales the spectrum so that its maximum will be one.  Therefore it is probably hard to say which method is more superior than the other, and their utility depends on the task and the dataset.  \n\nFor an additional set of comparative study, we implemented GANs with orthonormality constraint. For CIFAR10, spectral normalization outperformed the orthonormality constraint in terms of the inception score with most of the hyper-parameter settings.  On STL, our method seems to be losing with many hyper-parameter settings.  We summarize the inception scores achieved by the orthonormality method on CIFAR10 and STL.

Unlike our method, their method penalizes the spectral norm by additional regularization term (Eq.(1), https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10941). Their method is fundamentally different from our method in that they do not make an attempt to ‘set’ the spectral norm to a designated value.  Also, as we mention in Eq.(11) and (12), when we reorganize the derivative of our normalized cost function, we can see that our method is in fact practically imposing a “sample data dependent” regularization on the cost function.  \nSpectral norm regularization, on the other hand, imposes “sample data independent ” regularization on the cost function,  just like L2 regularization and Lasso. \nIn fact, when we trained GANs with 'spectral norm regularization', each layer’s spectral norm quickly shrunk to 0 and the training practically stopped. \n\nWe will momentarily add all these discussions and results to our revised version. \n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Spectral Normalization for Generative Adversarial Networks","abstract":"One of the challenges in the study of generative adversarial networks is the instability of its training. \nIn this paper, we propose a novel weight normalization technique called spectral normalization to stabilize the training of the discriminator.\nOur new normalization technique is computationally light and easy to incorporate into existing implementations. \nWe tested the efficacy of spectral normalization on CIFAR10, STL-10, and ILSVRC2012 dataset, and we experimentally confirmed that spectrally normalized GANs (SN-GANs) is capable of generating images of better or equal quality relative to the previous training stabilization techniques.

The ensuing GAN, coined SN-GAN, essentially ensures the Lipschitz property of the discriminator. This Lipschitz property has already been proposed by recent methods and has showed some success. However,  the authors here argue that spectral normalization is more powerful; it allows for models of higher rank (more non-zero singular values) which implies a more powerful discriminator and eventually more accurate generator. This is demonstrated in comparison to weight normalization in Figure 4. The experimental results are very good and give strong support for the proposed normalization.\n\n\nWhile the main idea is not new to machine learning (or deep learning), to the best of my knowledge it has not been applied on GANs. The paper is overall well written (though check Comment 3 below), it covers the related work well and it includes an insightful discussion about the importance of high rank models. I am recommending acceptance, though I anticipate to see a more rounded evaluation of the exact mechanism under which SN improves over the state of the art. More details in the comments below.\n\nComments:\n1. One concern about this paper is that it doesn’t fully answer the reasons why this normalization works better. I found the discussion about rank to be very intuitive, however this intuition is not fully tested.  Figure 4 reports layer spectra for SN and WN. The authors claim that other methods, like (Arjovsky et al. 2017) also suffer from the same rank deficiency. I would like to see the same spectra included. \n2. Continuing on the previous point: maybe there is another mechanism at play beyond just rank that give SN its apparent edge? One way to test the rank hypothesis and better explain this method is to run a couple of truncated-SN experiments. What happens if you run your SN but truncate its spectrum after every iteration in order to make it comparable to the rank of WN? Do you get comparable inception scores? Or does SN still win?\n3.

Here I chose to use the *new* value of both u and v, so that get u^T W v for free when I compute the normalizing constant for the new value of u.\n\nI am not sure if I am understanding the question clearly, but at each forward propagation, we prepare new u and v from the same set of u.     \nBy the way, we would like to note that we didn't propagate gradients thorough new_u and new_v .\nIf we write our code in Tensorflow, our implementation is like:\n       new_v = tf.nn.l2_normalize(tf.matmul(self.u, W), 1)\n       new_u = tf.nn.l2_normalize(tf.matmul(new_v, tf.transpose(W)), 1)\n       new_u = tf.stop_gradient(new_u)\n       new_v = tf.stop_gradient(new_v)\n       spectral_norm = tf.reduce_sum(new_u * tf.transpose(tf.matmul(W, tf.transpos e(new_v))), 1)\n       power_method_update =  tf.assign(self.u, new_u)\n\n>For convolution, I *think* I'm meant to use convolution and convolution transpose on a 4-D tensor, based on the comment in the paper about the sparse matrix, but I wasn't totally sure if I should do this or reshape the kernels into a matrix and use matrix-vector products.\n\nIn our implementations, we reshaped the 4D convolutional kernel into a 2-D matrix for the computation of the spectral norm. So, to be honest, our “spectral norm” does not include the parameters like padding and stride size.  We did away with these parameters just for the ease of computation.   So far however, this way is yielding satisfactory results.\n\nYour implementation is mathematically more faithful to our theoretical statement in that it is approximating the honest-to-goodness operator norm of the convolutional operator that includes these parameters.  We cannot say for 100% sure, but your speculate your way of computation shall work just fine.\n\n>I'm not 100% sure when I'm meant to run the `power_method_update` op.

It turned out that one power iteration was enough. \nTo check how good we are doing with one application of the power method,  we used SVD to compute the spectral norm of the convolution kernel normalized with our method (AppendixC.1)  Note that our method is doing just fine with  one power method. \n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Spectral Normalization for Generative Adversarial Networks","abstract":"One of the challenges in the study of generative adversarial networks is the instability of its training. \nIn this paper, we propose a novel weight normalization technique called spectral normalization to stabilize the training of the discriminator.\nOur new normalization technique is computationally light and easy to incorporate into existing implementations. \nWe tested the efficacy of spectral normalization on CIFAR10, STL-10, and ILSVRC2012 dataset, and we experimentally confirmed that spectrally normalized GANs (SN-GANs) is capable of generating images of better or equal quality relative to the previous training stabilization techniques.
