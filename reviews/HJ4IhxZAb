Nevertheless, the other work that is being confused here, Chu and Lin (2016)'s Transfer LSA, improves over ALBL with cross-dataset generalisation, albeit in a sequential setting with a bandit learner rather than an RL learner. In this sense, it is suggested that the authors compare with T-LSA to justify the difference between RL and bandit (and perhaps non-myopic versus myopic), and with ALBL to justify the need of cross-dataset (which is readily done by the authors). Also, T-LSA needs some on-the-fly adaptive learning with bandit on the new data set while the proposed RL approach does not. So it would be interesting to know their differences.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Meta-Learning Transferable Active Learning Policies by Deep Reinforcement Learning","abstract":"Active learning (AL) aims to enable training high performance classifiers with low annotation cost by predicting which subset of unlabelled instances would be most beneficial to label.

We customised it for application to AL here. For example, the representative embedding encodes information about the spread of the dataset itself (unlabelled component) and the spread of the queries so far (labelled component). While the discriminative embedding  contains information about how the current leaner certainty varies with the position of an instance within the spread of the dataset (through encoding posterior certainty jointly with position). \n\nConvergence: Yes the policy is stabilising. This is now illustrated in Appendix Sec 7.1, Fig 3.\n\nFixed budget: AL is mainly of interest in settings when a small budget must be carefully spent. We agree extending to budgets of 100 or more is within the interesting range. But we leave this for future work as we didn't have time to run these experiments yet. \n\n2D histogram: To clarify: Each feature dimension of input is encoded by a joint histogram counting: (1) The frequency of instances with a value of that feature within each bin and (2) The frequency of instances with a given posterior probability according to the base classifier so far (IE: binning on the base classifier's probability value between [0,1] that the given instance is class +1 vs class -1).  We clarified this in Sec 3.1.\n\nExplain A(Z): This is the MSE of reconstruction of the instances by the autoencoder. Now clarified in Sec 3.2.\n\nQuantitative Comparison. Myopic/ALBL: The reviewer mentioned they would like evidence of RL policy benefit vs myopic bandit learner. We would like to reiterate that the mentioned point here is only one out of two contributions here. We perform non-myopic learning with RL, but the second contribution is the learning of cross-dataset generalisation which is not attempted at all in prior work such as Chu and Lin's ALBL. We have now added ALBL to the experimental comparison, (as well as QBB suggested by R3). We can see that MLP-GAL is clearly better than ALBL in the updated Tables 1 and 2. To understand why: Recall that ALBL performs bandit-based learning within-dataset without knowledge transfer. Its underlying bandit learner is designed for asymptotic performance. In the few-shot scenario of active learning, it suffers critically from the fundamental explore/exploit dilemma. ALBL must use the limited active queries to do exploration for learning. By the time it has explored enough to define a good learner, it has a small active query budget remaining to exploit this knowledge. This is particularly detrimental in our tough setting of only 20 queries per dataset. In contrast by doing cross-dataset transfer, our MLP-GAL completely avoids this limitation. It gets all its learning done on different source datasets and can go straight to \"exploiting\" when tested on a novel dataset. \n\nQuantitative comparison. Adaptive learning on the Fly: We assume the reviewer is referring to the meta-network in this question. The relevant comparison is then between MLP-GAL and Single-RL which is trained in a similar multi-task way, but excludes the meta-network that helps the policy adapt to new target datasets. We can see that MLP-GAL outperform Single-RL in the results (Tab 1, and more clearly in Tab 2). This is despite that the latter adds significantly more expert features in order to make it approximate a non-myopic RL-upgraded version of the expert feature-based supervised learner in Konyushkova et al, NIPS, 2017. \n\nRL Approach chosen: For simplicity we chose PG, as the simplest classic direct policy search method. More advanced methods (actor-critic, TRPO, etc) could be potentially used to further improve performance. We tried DQN-based Q-learning and it did not work as well due to being hard to stabilise the training. We believe Q-learning should also work in principle but may be more sensitive to tuning hyperparameters for good stability.\n\nEq 2: Yes there a potential parameter here that could be tuned to improve performance, but we did not use one. So the weight value is 1. Now clarified.\n\nTypos: Thanks.

The standard cost bracket of most active learning methods is O(ND) each iteration for N instances and D dimensions. Ours is in this bracket along with the pervasive Entropy/US, and thus we can address problems of the same size as any standard active learner. DFF, for example, is a qualitatively more costly O(N^2 D), which makes it non-scalable to large problems. \n\nTraining our model is fairly costly, but by training a model capable of cross-dataset transfer, the idea is that retraining is rarely required.\n\nLinear and RBF SVM: In the RBF experiment table (Tab 3, 4 in submission. Tab 2 in revised paper), the results are based on completely retraining the policy network using a RBF-base learner. Since we did not meta-train for base-learner invariance, we would not expect it to generalise across changes of base learner. Meta-training for base learner invariance is an interesting avenue for future work.\n\nBigger Problems: We agree this is an exciting major test for going forward in this line of research. Given the other requested experiments, which required all our GPUs, we did not have time to address this in the available period. We think that the existing experiments, particularly with the revised updates already validates the basic concept.

The focus is on the key aspect, which is generalisation across heteregeneous data. The novel idea is the dataset embedding so that their RL policy can be trained to work across diverse datasets.\n\nPros: \n1. The approach performs well against all the baselines, and also achieves good cross-task generalisation in the tasks they evaluated on. \n2. In particular, they alsoevaluated on test datasets with fairly different statistics from the training datasets, which isnt very common in most meta-learning papers today, so it’s encouraging that the method works in that regime.\n\nCons: \n1. The embedding strategy, especially the representative and discriminative histograms, is complicated. It is unclear if the strategy is general enough to work on harder problems / larger datasets, or with higher dimensional data like images. More evidence in the paper for why it would work on harder problems would be great. \n2. The policy network would have to output a probability for each datapoint in the dataset U, which could be fairly large, thus the method is computationally much more expensive than random sampling. A section devoted to showing what practical problems could be potentially solved by this method would be useful.\n3. It is unclear to me if the results in table 3 and 4 are achieved by retraining from scratch with an RBF SVM, or by freezing the policy network trained on a linear SVM and directly evaluating it with a RBF SVM base learner.\n\nSignificance/Conclusion: The idea of meta-learning or learning to learn is fairly common now.
