We have updated our paper, especially the experiment section. Below are the detailed answers to your concerns.\n\n“experiment confusing”: Sorry for the confusion, and we have made this clearer in the updated paper. The defense model is simply adding two randomization layers to the beginning of the original classification networks. There is no re-training and fine-tuning needed. This is an advantage of our method. We choose Inception-v3, ResNet-v2, Inception-ResNet-v2 and ens-adv-Inception-ResNet-v2 as the original CNN models, and these models are public available under Tensorflow github repo. The target models are the models used by attackers to generate adversarial examples. The target models differ under different attack scenarios: (1) vanilla attack: the target model is the original CNN model, e.g. Inception-v3; (2) single-pattern attack: target model is the original CNN model + randomization layers with only one predefined pattern; (3) ensemble-pattern attack: the target model is the original CNN model + randomization layers with an ensemble of predefined patterns. Note that the structure and weights of the classification network in target model and defense model are exactly the same. In tables 2-6, the attackers first use target model to generate adversarial examples, and then tests the top-1 accuracy on target model and defense model. Specifically, (1) for target model, a lower accuracy indicates a more successful attack; (2) for defense model, a higher accuracy indicates a more successful defense. \n\n“stronger baseline when the attacker is fully aware the patterns”: We agree that the performance gap between the target and defense model will shrink as more randomization patterns are considered in the attack process. This is expected. Here we want to emphasize that during defense, the padding and resizing are done randomly, so there is no way for both the attacker and the defender to know the exact instantiated patterns. The strongest possible attack would be that the attackers consider ALL possible patterns when generating the adversarial examples. However, this is not possible. Failing all patterns takes extremely long time, and may not even converge. For example, under our randomization setting, the total number of patterns (resizing + padding) is 12528. Thus, instead of choosing such a large number, we choose 21 representative patterns in our ensemble attack scenario, which becomes computationally manageable. Increasing the number of ensembled patterns means: (1) more computation time (take C&W for example, it takes around 0.56 min to generate an adversarial example under vanilla attack, but takes around 8 min to generate an adversarial example under ensemble attack); (2) more memory consumption (at most an ensemble of 30 different patterns can be utilized as one batch to generated adversarial examples for one 12GB GPU, more patterns indicates more GPUs or the GPU with larger memory); (3) larger magnitude of adversarial perturbation.\n\n“biased towards the published adversarial attacks”: Our defense method is not trained using any adversarial examples, so we don’t think it is biased towards any attacks. We extensively test our method on the most popular attacks (one single-step attack FGSM, and two representative iterative attacks DeepFool and C&W), with various network structures, and using large-scale ImageNet datasets. Moreover, we submit this method to a public adversarial defense challenge. Our method is evaluated against 156 different attacks and we are ranked Top 2, which indicates the effectiveness of our method.\n\n“particular problem (e.g. classification) and additive noise”: Currently most works on this topic focus on classification problem and assume additive noise as adversarial perturbation. We follow this setting in this paper. We have two future directions to explore: 1) apply randomization to other vision tasks, 2) apply randomization to other types of attack instead of additive noise.

We have conducted additional experiments to answer the concerns. These experiments results are included as appendix in the updated paper.\n\n“Other operations”: Yes, other random operations also apply. We tried four operations separately:  random brightness, random contrast, random saturation, and random hue. For each individual operation, we add it to the beginning of the original classification network. We found that these operations nearly have no hurts on the performance of clean images (shown in table 7), but they are not as effective as the proposed randomization layers on defending adversarial examples (shown in table 8-11). By combining these random operations with the proposed randomization layers, the performance on defending adversarial examples can be slightly improved. We have updated these new results in the Appendix A.\n\n“resized beforehand”: Yes, the test images are resized beforehand. There are two reasons: (1) easy to form a batch (e.g., one batch contains 100 images) for classification; (2) stay aligned with the format of the public competition, where the test dataset are all of the size 299x299x3. For the images with variable sizes, we can first resize them to 299x299x3, and then applied the proposed method to defend adversarial examples.\n\n“impact of size in performance”: Adding two randomization layers (increasing size from 299 to 331) slightly downgrades the performance on clean images, as shown in Table 1. This decrease becomes negligible for stronger models. In addition, we also tried applying randomization to smaller-sized images. Specifically, we first resize the images to a size randomly sampled from the range [267, 299), and then randomly pad it to 299x299x3. We evaluate the performance on both the 5000 clean images and the adversarial examples generated under the vanilla attack scenario (shown in table 12). We see that the randomization method works well with smaller sizes, but using larger sizes produces slightly better results. We hypothesize that this is because resizing an image to smaller sizes may lose some information. We have updated the new results in the Appendix B.\n\n“padding or resizing increase”: As the padding size or resizing size increase, there will be a lot more random patterns. So it becomes much harder for the attackers to generate the adversarial example that can fail all the patterns at the same time. Thus, larger size and more paddings will significantly increase the robustness. Notice that the motivation for the experiments in Sec 4.6 is to decouple the effect of padding and resizing. We want to show that (1) adversarial example generated on one padding pattern is hard to transfer to another padding pattern; (2) adversarial example generated on one size is hard to transfer to another size. Using 1-pixel padding and resizing provide a controllable way to verify these two points.\n\n“multiple iterations per image”: The computation time increases linearly with number of iteration per image (e.g., 30x time in our challenge submission). We argue that one iteration is enough to get the most benefits, and additional evaluations only provide marginal gain (as shown in figures 3-5), which is good for the challenge.  The experiments that show the relationship between the classification performance and iteration number is included in Appendix C.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Mitigating Adversarial Effects Through Randomization","abstract":"Convolutional neural networks have demonstrated their powerful ability on various tasks in recent years.

This work is done on large-scale datasets like ImageNet, and only a few defenses (including adversarial training) have demonstrated the effectiveness before. Though MNIST is an interesting dataset on which to test defense ideas, the conclusions may not be readily applied to ImageNet. 2). The attack scenarios considered in our paper are much stronger than black-box attacks. I.e., the network structures and parameters are completely known by the attackers.\n\nIn the paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on basic C&W attacks, which are very challenging already, and were not well studied on ImageNet before. In order to overcome the problem that randomization models are not differentiable, we considered single-pattern attacks and ensemble-pattern attacks in the experiments. The experimental results indicate that adversarial examples generated under ensemble-pattern attacks are stronger than others. Note that the C&W attacks are very slow. Take the basic C&W attack against inception-resnet-v2 for example. It takes ~17 mins to generate adversarial examples for a batch of 30 images under vanilla attack scenario, and takes ~8 mins to generate adversarial examples for 1 image under ensemble-pattern attack scenario. Generating higher-confidence adversarial examples will significantly increase the time consumption even further, and thus, may not be practical. So we focus on basic C&W attacks in our experiments at current stage. \n\nFor the baseline included in this paper, we want to point out three things. 1). To the best of our knowledge, adversarial training is the most effectiveness method on large-scale dataset like ImageNet. We are confused by the words “the state-of-the-art defense”, please refer to it explicitly. 2). The adversarially trained model is not robust to iterative attacks, and is used more like a network backbone rather than baseline in our paper. We combine the adversarially trained model, which is robust to single-step attacks, and randomization layers, which improve network robustness to iterative attacks, together to form our best defense model. 3). There are 100+ defense teams and 150+ attacks teams participate in this public adversarial defense challenge, and our model is ranked top 2. We argue that this challenge provides us sufficient baselines (including very strong ones) to compare with, which convincingly demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in real world scenario.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Mitigating Adversarial Effects Through Randomization","abstract":"Convolutional neural networks have demonstrated their powerful ability on various tasks in recent years.

We will conduct experiments to see how our defense model performs under vanilla attack, single-pattern attack and ensemble attack when confidence increases.\n\nWe want to highlight our defense is evaluated on large-scale real image dataset, e.g., ImageNet, which is much harder than defense on small dataset, like MNIST and CIFAR.

For example,  adversarial training helps model get better performance on MNIST, but causes performance to drop on ImageNet (see table 1 at [2])\n\n(2) To the best of my knowledge, there are no randomization-based defense methods available on ImageNet (except some concurrent submissions at ICLR).
