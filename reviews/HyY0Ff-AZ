However, we are not in full agreement with the specific concern voiced here - our shorter proof indeed uses fairly well-known statistical tools, for instance in the Legendre transform of the log-Laplace. But of the several papers highlighting the equivalence of soft Q-learning and entropy regularized policy gradients published this year (at least three, see for instance Nachum et al.'s https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08892 or Schulman et al.'s https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06440, or the anonymous submission https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HJjvxl-Cb), none to our knowledge used this representation formula that expedites the proof singularly. The technique gives very intuitively soft Q-learning as a Cramer-Chernoff transform, and could be applied to other regularizers ; furthermore, the paper highlights a connection with large deviations that could be helpful in future work, for instance by applying relevant changes of measure.\n\nThe sentence 'we have restricted so far the proof in the bandit setting' refers to applying the representation formula in the one-step return case for clarity ; this is terminology used for instance in Schulman et al.'s article https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06440.\n\nWe do agree - and state in the abstract -  that the proof of equivalence of soft Q-learning and entropy regularization is not a novelty of our article."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Representing Entropy : A short proof of the equivalence between soft Q-learning and policy gradients","abstract":"Two main families of reinforcement learning algorithms, Q-learning and policy gradients, have recently been proven to be equivalent when using a softmax relaxation on one part, and an entropic regularization on the other.

The originality comes from the conciseness of the proof and how it relates to other works outside ML. Thus, this contribution seems minor and out of the scope of the conference which focus on representation learning for ML and RL.\n\nSuggestion: I strongly suggest the authors to work on a more detailed proof for the RL case explaining for instance the minimal conditions (on the reward, on the ergodicity of the MDP) in which the equivalence holds and submit it to a more theoretically oriented conference such as COLT or NIPS.   \n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Representing Entropy : A short proof of the equivalence between soft Q-learning and policy gradients","abstract":"Two main families of reinforcement learning algorithms, Q-learning and policy gradients, have recently been proven to be equivalent when using a softmax relaxation on one part, and an entropic regularization on the other.

There is no doubt that all the tools that are detailed here are extremely useful and powerful results in mathematical statistics. But they are all known.\n\nThe Gibbs variational principle is folklore, Proposition 1,2 are available in all good text books on the topic, \nand Proposition 4 is nothing but a transportation Lemma.\nNow, Proposition 3 is about soft-Bellman operators. This perhaps is less standard because contraction property of soft-Bellman operator in infinite norm is more recent than for Bellman operators.\nBut as mentioned by the authors, this is not new either. \nAlso I don't really see the point of providing the proofs of these results in the main material, and not for instance in appendix, as there is no novelty either in the proof techniques.\n\nI don't get the sentence \"we have restricted so far the proof in the bandit setting\": bandits are not even mentioned earlier.\n\nDecision\n********\nI am sorry but unless I missed something (that then should be clarified) this seems to be an empty paper: Strong reject.","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Representing Entropy : A short proof of the equivalence between soft Q-learning and policy gradients","abstract":"Two main families of reinforcement learning algorithms, Q-learning and policy gradients, have recently been proven to be equivalent when using a softmax relaxation on one part, and an entropic regularization on the other.

This is stated in Equation (13) in the paper. However, this precise representation of the Bellman error (with costs instead of rewards and with minimization instead of maximization) has been known in the literature on risk-sensitive control, see, e.g., P. D. Pra, L. Meneghini, and W. J. Runggaldier, “Connections between stochastic control and dynamic games,” Math. Control Signals Systems, vol. 9, pp. 303–326, 1996. The same applies to contraction results for the \"softmax\" Bellman operator -- these results are not novel at all, see, e.g., D. Hernandez-Hernandez and S. I. Marcus, “Risk sensitive control of Markov processes in countable state space,” Systems and Control Letters, vol. 29, pp. 147–155, 1996.\n\nAlso, there are some errors in the paper: for example, the functional of $\\pi(a|s)$ in Eq.
