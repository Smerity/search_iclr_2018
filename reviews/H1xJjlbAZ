The main contribution of our paper is to systematically demonstrate for the first time that interpretation of neural networks are fragile to attacks. This is an important topic and your questions raise interesting future research directions. \n\n1. The limitation of the attack method is a very interesting research direction. The attacks that we designed in our paper are all white-box attacks that need to know the NN model. Our next question to answer would be the dangers of interpretations attacks in the black-box setting without access to the model.\n\n2.  The reviewer asks how reliable are the interpretation methods. Although these methods are widely used(e.g. Quang and Xie 17, Kelly and Reshev 17), there is not a unified definition of reliability that has been investigated and it is an active area of research(Doshi-Velez & Kim, 2017). One of the contributions of our work is to systematically compare the robustness of the interpretations generated by these different methods. Our work shows that is possible to change regions of high saliency through careful perturbations of the test images (see Fig. 2). So the methods are correctly identifying new interpretations, but these interpretations disagree with human notions of what part of an image is most related to interpretation. \n\n3. As the reviewer mentions, we defined metrics (rank correlation and top-k intersection, and also center shift metric in Appendix D) to compare the interpretations of two different images. In order to make it clear how these metrics correspond to intuitive notions of stability, we have included a new figure, Figure 3, and a new appendix, Appendix C, which provides an example of how rank correlations and top-k intersection change as randomly sampled validation images are adversarially perturbed. \n\n4 .We agree that medical case is one of the most important problems for the application influence functions and one way to evaluate the perturbations is to look at the concordance with human studies. \n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"INTERPRETATION OF NEURAL NETWORK IS FRAGILE","abstract":"In order for machine learning to be deployed and trusted in many applications, it is crucial to be able to reliably explain why the machine learning algorithm makes certain predictions.

Our conclusions are actually exactly the same as yours! Our main contribution is to show that the interpretation (e.g. the saliency map of an image) can be significantly perturbed by adversarial attacks; we do not claim that the interpretation method (e.g. DeepLift) is broken by the attacks. This completely agrees with your point. \n\nOur operational definition that an interpretation is fragile is “two perceptively indistinguishable inputs with the same predicted label can be assigned very different interpretations”. All of our experiments support our conclusion that interpretations can be adversarially attacked by this definition. We used this definition because it’s analogous to the fragility notion used in the broader adversarial attack and ML security community.  We do not claim in the paper that the interpretation method itself is broken by our attacks. This is a subtle and important distinction. We have added a new paragraph in the Conclusion  section to clarify this:\n\n“Our results demonstrate that the \\emph{interpretations} (e.g. saliency maps) are vulnerable to perturbations, but this does not imply that the \\emph{interpretation methods} are broken by the perturbations. This is a subtle but important distinction. Methods such as saliency measure the infinitesimal sensitivity of the neural network at a particular input $\\xb$. After a perturbation, the input has changed to $\\tilde{\\xb} = \\xb + \\deltb$, and the salency now measures the  sensitivity at the perturbed input. The saliency \\emph{correctly} captures the infinitesimal sensitivity at the two inputs; it's doing what it is supposed to do. The fact that the two resulting saliency maps are very different is fundamentally due to the network itself being fragile to such perturbations, as we illustrate with Fig.~\\ref{fig:concept}.”\n\nYou asked about the quality of our DeepLIFT saliency maps. We implemented DeepLIFT with rescale rule as described by the original authors [https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02685 ]. We have released the code for our implementation at [https://goo.gl/6usSEk]. We have checked the code several times and we also closely work with the the lab developing DeepLIFT in the area of interpretability.\n\nRegarding your remark that heat-maps should be normalized using a common factor. It’s important to notice that the measures used for comparing the original and perturbed saliency maps (top-K intersection and rank order correlation) are independent from the normalizing scheme.\n\nRegarding your suggestion a training strategy to make networks more robust to such adversarial examples, and suggested retraining a network using softplus activations. These are very helpful suggestions that we will consider for future direction.\n\nDoes this help to address your question? We believe that our conclusions are the same as yours. Please let us know if the new discussions we’ve added to the revision clarify this confusion. The key contribution of our work is to extend adversarial attacks to interpretations for the first time, and this raises interesting security questions given how important interpretations are. Please let us know if there are additional analysis you’d like to see. We hope to engage in a dialogue until we can resolve all of your concerns. \n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"INTERPRETATION OF NEURAL NETWORK IS FRAGILE","abstract":"In order for machine learning to be deployed and trusted in many applications, it is crucial to be able to reliably explain why the machine learning algorithm makes certain predictions.

We think it’s certainly interesting to explore other metrics, and our paper opens the door for that. There are two main motivations for our metric/definition of fragility. \n\n1. Our definition is well-motivated by practice. Suppose you have a pathology image that is predicted to be a malignant tumor, as an example. The clinician might then use some saliency map to interpret which part of the image is the most informative. The reliability of this interpretation exactly maps onto our fragility metric: the input image always have measurement errors and our fragility metric quantifies whether the same parts of the image would light up as informative across different measurement errors. This motivates defining fragility as we do. \n\n2.

The authors perturb input images and create explanations using different methods. Even though the image is inperceptibly different to a human observer, the authors observe large changes in the heatmaps visualizing the explanation maps. This is true even for random perturbations. \n\nThe images have been modified wrt. to some noise, such that they deviate from the natural statistics for images of that kind. Since the explanation algorithms investigated in this papers merely react to the interactions of the model to the input and thus are unsupervised processes in nature, the explanation methods merely show the model's reaction to the change.\nFor one, the model itself reacts to the perturbation, which can be measured by the (considarbly) increased class probability. Since the prediction score is given in probabilty values, the reviewer assumes the final layer of the model is a SoftMax activation. In order to see change in the softmax output score, especially if the already dominant prediction score is further increased, a lot of change has to happen to the outputs of the layer serving as input to the SoftMax layer.\n\nIt can thus be expected, that the input- and class specific explanations change as well, to an also not so small extent. The explanation maps mirror for the considered methods the model's reaction to the input. They are thus not meaningless, but are a measure to model reaction instead of an independent process. The excellent Figure 2 supports this point. Not the interpretation itself is fragile, but the model.\nAdding a small delta to the sample x shifts its position in data space, completely altering the prediction rule applied by the model due to the change in proximity to another section of the decision hyperplane. The fragility of DNN models to marginally perturbed inputs themselves is well known. \nThis especially true for adversial perturbations, which have been used as test cases in this work. The explanation methods are expected to highlight highly important areas in an image, which have been targetet by these perturbation approaches.\n\nThe authors give an example of an adversary manipulating the input in order to draw the activation to specific features to draw confusing/malignant explanation maps. In a settig of model verification, the explanation via heatmaps is exactly what one wants to have: If tiny change to the image causes lots of change to the prediction (and explanation) we can visualize the instability of the model not the explanation method.\nFurther do targeted perturbations not show the fragility of explanation methods, but rather that the models actually find what is important to the model. It can be expected, that after a change to these parts of the input, the model will decide differently, albeit coming to the same conclusion (in terms of predicted class membership), which reflects in the explanation map computed for the perturbed input.\n\nFurther remarks:\nIt would be interesting to see the size and position of the center of mass attacks in the appendix. The reviewer closely follows and is experienced with various explanation methods, their application and the quality of the expected explanations. The reviewer is therefore surprised by the poor quality and lack of structure in the maps obtained from the DeepLift method. Can bugs and suboptimal configurations be ruled out during the experiments? The DeepLift explanations are almost as noisy as the ones obtained for Sensitivity Analysis (i.e. the gradient at the input point). However, recent work (e.g. Samek et al., IEEE TNNLS, 2017 or Montavon et al., Digital Signal Processing, 2017) showed that decomposition-based methods (such as DeepLift) provide less noisy explanations than Sensitivity Analysis.\n\nHave the authors considered training the net with small random perturbations added to the samples, to compare the \"vanilla\" model to the more robust one, which has seen noisy samples, and compared explanations? \nWhy not train (finetune) the considered models using softplus activations instead of exchanging activation nodes?\nAppendix B: Heatmaps through the different stages of perturbation should be normalized using a common factor, not individually, in order to better reflect the change in the explanation\n\nConclusion:\nThe paper follows an interesting approach, but ultimately takes the wrong view point:\nThe authors try to attribute fragility to explaining methods, which visualize/measure the reaction of the model to the perturbed inputs. A major rework should be considered.","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"INTERPRETATION OF NEURAL NETWORK IS FRAGILE","abstract":"In order for machine learning to be deployed and trusted in many applications, it is crucial to be able to reliably explain why the machine learning algorithm makes certain predictions.

what is being interpreted.\n\nIt is shown that it is possible to imperceptibly change an image such that the gradient w.r.t. to the input changes, but without changing the classifier’s output.\nSince most interpretability methods are based on the gradient this changes their interpretation.\nThis is where the paper makes a mistake by ignoring the meaning of the gradient or saliency map (as defined

decision was made.\nSince the function might be different, the explanation should not necessarily be the same. \nIt might very well be possible that the network’s decision needs to be interpreted differently now.\nIntuitively, this can be understood by realizing that for many problems the same decision can be made based on different subsets of evidence.\n\nSince there is no certainty that the decision was made in an identical manner for the original datapoint and the modified one,\n It is NOT possible to conclude that interpretability methods are fragile.\n\nAdditionally, the theoretical analysis also make an incorrect claim. \nThe paper states that a logistic regression network is susceptible to the adversarial attack on the interpretability.\nThis is not correct.\nIn the case that the logistic model (two or multi-class) is analyzed from the logit (as is done commonly in the papers by Bach et al, Simonyan et al ,…..) the gradient w.r.t. the input is always the weight vector. \nIn a two class setting where a sigmoid is added, the gradient becomes a scaled version of the weight vector. \nFor this reason interpretability is not fragile here either.\nTherefore at least a multi class logistic regression is needed and the methods have to be applied to the output post-softmax.\nPlease not that this is not how the original papers describe the approach how to use these methods.\n\nTo conclude, I think the manuscript shows an interesting effect but it draws the wrong conclusions.\nThe fact that the network’s function can change drastically due to a small change in the input without affecting the prediction is surprising.\nThis is an effect similar to the original observation of adversarial examples.\nHowever it does NOT show fragility of interpretability maps.\nFor this reason, I believe that the paper needs to be updated before it can be accepted.\nThe observed effect does warrant further investigation and is an interesting finding."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"INTERPRETATION OF NEURAL NETWORK IS FRAGILE","abstract":"In order for machine learning

In fact, our experimental results on ImageNet (Figs 1 and 3) were all produced for Sqeezenet, which has maxpooling and average pooling layers. The reason this works is as follows: when computing the attack direction, we replace ReLU with Softplus so we have non-zero second gradients. Max-pooling simply picks out a particular neuron to pass through, so it will have non-zero second order gradients as long as the activation has non-zero second gradient  (except on a set of measure zero).  The second order chain rule has two terms, one of which, is zero as the second order gradient of maxpooling is zero. The other term is non-zero as long as the activation functions of the network have non-zero second order gradients. For more clarification please look at Faà di Bruno's formula for second order derivative.  (You can empirically confirm it by building a simple network in Tensroflow with softplus activation and a maxpool layer and take the second order gradient).\nNote that we use this Softplus network only for the purpose of finding an attack direction, we still compute saliency with respect to the original ReLU network, as we discussed in the paper. This means that our attacks can be applied to any ReLU network with or without pooling.  \nYou are correct that the main message of our paper is that reliability of neural network interpretation is fragile, and we developed approaches to systematically quantify this effect for the first time.

However, notice that the saliency map itself is a gradient of the maxlogit w.r.t the input. The gradient for a neural network is usually calculated by using the backpropagation, which depends on the forward pass. So, for any network with pooling layers, the gradient of the saliency map w.r.t the input is not calculable, because the pooling layers, when you calculate the gradient for the second time, are not differentiable. In the paper, you only point out that for the widely used activation function Relu, in order to avoid the zero gradient problem, we can replace it with a softplus activation. \n\nOne possible way to solve this problem is to stop the gradient of D w.r.t the input x at the saliency map level. However, this fix doesn't make sense mathematically, though it might can still be an attack method. \n\nConsidering that most of the networks will contain pooling layers, I think the application of this attack method is limited.

The most prevalent objective measure in the literature has been weakly-supervised object localization which is basically trying to localize the classified object using the most salient input dimensions(pixels). Simonyan et al discussed this measure in their original work for the simple gradient method and reported less than 50% error. DeepLIFT and Integrated Gradients methods have not been yet applied to the task of localization to the best of our knowledge.\n    As a subjective comment, however, I have to say that all of the three mentioned feature importance methods are successful (nearly all the time) in pointing to the region of important pixels (in other words the region of image containing the classified object); what makes them different in performance, is how noisy the saliency map is. In other words, how many non-important pixels(subjectively) are pointed out by the feature importance method to be important or how many missing important pixels one can detect in the salient part of the heat map. It could be said that Integrated Gradients results in the best subjective saliency map and also DeepLIFT has acceptable performance. Examples of both could be found in https://github.com/ankurtaly/Integrated-Gradients and https://github.com/kundajelab/deeplift, respectively. Also, the recent \"SmoothGrad: removing noise by adding noise\" paper has tried to solve the problem of noisy saliency maps and they have reported convincing results.\n    Understanding whether influence functions provide meaningful explanations is more challenging since training examples can influence the prediction of a test image in different ways. For example, a very similar-looking training image from the same class may help the classifier identify the test image, but so can a very different-looking training image from a different class. As such, we find that the training examples that are identified as the most helpful by influence functions are not generally the same as those images that are visually similar to the test image. However, regardless of the meaningfulness of influence functions on a particular test image, we show that across the test images, we are able to perturb the ordering of the training image influences."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"INTERPRETATION OF NEURAL NETWORK IS FRAGILE","abstract":"In order for machine learning to be deployed and trusted in many applications, it is crucial to be able to reliably explain why the machine learning algorithm makes certain predictions.
