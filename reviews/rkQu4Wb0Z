Summary\nThe authors of the paper compare the learning of representations in DNNs with Shannons channel coding theory, which deals with reliably sending information through channels. In channel coding theory the statistical properties of the coding of the information can be designed to fit the task at hand. With DNNs the representations cannot be designed in the same way. But the representations, learned by DNNs, can be affected indirectly by applying regularization. Regularizers can be designed to affect statistical properties of the representations, such as sparsity, variance, or covariance. The paper extends the regularizers to perform per-class regularization. This makes sense, because, for example, forcing the variance of a representation to go towards zero is undesirable as it would state that the unit always has the same output no matter the input. On the other hand having zero variance for a class is desirable as it means that the unit has a consistent activation for all samples of the same class. The paper compares different regularization techniques regarding their error performance. They find that applying representation regularization outperforms classical approaches such as L1 and L2 weight regularization. They also find, that performing representation regularization on the last layer achieves the best performance. Class-wise methods generally outperform methods that apply regularization on all classes.\n\n2. Remarks\nShannons channel coding theory was used by the authors to derive regularizers, that manipulate certain statistical properties of representations learned by DNNs. In the reviewers opinion, there is no theoretical connection between DNNs and channel theory. For one, DNNs are no channels in the sense that they transmit information. DNNs are rather pipes that transform information from one domain to another, where representations are learned as an intermediate model as the information is being transformed. Noise introduced in the process is not due to a faulty channel but due to the quality of the learned representations themselves. The paper falls short in explaining how DNNs and Shannons channel coding theory fit together theoretically and how they used it to derive the proposed regularizers. Despite the theoretical gap between the two was not properly bridged by the authors, channel coding theory is still a good metaphor for what they were trying to achieve.\nThe authors recognize that there is similar research being done independently by Belharbi et al. (2017). The similarities and differences between the proposed work and Belharbi et al. should be discussed in more detail.\nThe authors conclude that it is unclear which statistical properties of representations are generally helpful when being strengthened. It would be nice if they had derived at least a set of rules of thumb. Especially because none of the regularizers described in the paper only target one specific statistical property but multiple. One good example that was provided, is that L1-rep consistently failed to train on CIFAR-100, because too much sparsity can hurt performance, when having many different classes (100 in this case). These kinds of conclusions will make it easier to transfer the presented theory into practice.\n\n3. Conclusion\nThe comparison between DNNs and Shannons channel coding theory stands on shaky ground. The proposed regularizes are rather simple, but perform well in the experiments. The effect of each regularizer on the statistical properties of the representation and the relations to previous work (especially Belharbi et al. (2017)) should be discussed in more detail.

While some of the proposed regularizers are applied to weights, most are applied to hidden representations of neural networks. Class-wise regularizations are also investigated for the purpose of fine-grained control of statistics within each class. Experiments over MNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 demonstrate the usefulness of this technique.\n\nThe following related work also studied the regularizations on hidden representations which are motivated from clustering perspective and share some similarities with the proposed one.

However, do you check this criterion over the whole epoch or just some mini-batches?\n\nOverall, I think the paper is technically sound. But the novelty and significance are a bit unsatisfactory.
