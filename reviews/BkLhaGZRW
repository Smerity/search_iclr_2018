This is achieved by penalizing the correlation between responses of hidden nodes and promoting low entropy intra node. Numerical experiments that demonstrate the diversity increment on the generated samples are shown.\n\nConcerns.\n\nThe paper is hard do tear and it is deficit to identify the precise contribution of the authors. Such contribution can, in my opinion, be summarized  in a potential of the form\n\nwith\n\n$$\nR_BRE = a R_ME+ b R_AC = a \\sum_k  \\sum_i s_{ki}^2   +  b \\sum_{<k,l>} \\sum_i \\{ s_{ki} s_{li} \\}   \n$$\n(Note that my version of R_ME is different to the one proposed by the authors, but it could have the same effect)\n\nWhere a and b are parameters that weight the relative contribution of each term  (maybe computed as suggested in the paper).\n\nIn this formulation:\n\nThen R_ME has a high response if the node has saturated responses -1’s or 1``s, as one desire such saturated responses, a should be negative.\n\nThe R_AC, penalizes correlation between responses of different nodes.\n\nThe point is, \n\na) The second term will introduce  low correlation in saturated vectors, then the will be informative. \n \nb) why the authors use the softsign instead the tanh:  $tahnh \\in C^2 $! Meanwhile the derivative id softsign is discontinuous.\n\nc)  It is not clear is the softsign is used besides the activation function: In page 5 is said “R_BRE can be applied on ant rectified layer before the nolinearity” . This seems tt the authors propose to add a second activation function (the softsign), why not use the one is in teh layer?\n\nd) The authors found hard to regularize the gradient $\\nabla_x D(x)$, even they tray tanh and cosine based activations. It seems that effectively, the  introduce their additional softsign in the process.\n\ne) En the definition of R_AC, I denoted by <k,l> the pair of nodes (k \\ne l). However, I think that it should be for pair in the same layer. It is not clear in the paper.\n\nf) It is supposed that the L_1 regularization motes the weights to be informative, this work is doing something similar. How is it compared  the L_1 regularization vs. the proposal?\n\nRecommendation\nI tried to read the paper several times and I accept that it was very hard to me. The most difficult part is the lack of precision on the maths, it is hard to figure out what the authors contribution indeed are. I think there is some merit in the work. However, it is not very well organized and many points are not defined. In my opinion, the paper is in a preliminary stage and should be refined. I recommend a “SOFT” REJECT\n","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Improving diversity in Generative adversarial networks by encouraging discriminator representation entropy","abstract":"We propose a novel regularizer for the training of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) so that the generator can better capture the variations within the real data distribution, thus helps to avoid subtle model collapse and improve the performance of GANs.

It seems the concept of \"binarized activation patterns\", which the proposed regularizer is designed upon, is closely coupled with rectifier nets. I would therefore suggest the authors to highlight this assumption / constraint more clearly e.g. in the abstract.\n\n2. In order for the paper to be more self-contained, maybe list at least once the formula for \"rectifier net\" (sth. like \"a^T max(0, wx + b) + c\") ? This might also help the readers better understand where the polytopes in Figure 1 come from.\n\n3. In section 3.1, when presenting random variables (U_1, ..., U_d), I find the word \"Bernourlli\" a bit misleading because typically people would expect U_i to take values from {0, 1} whereas here you assume {-1, +1}. This can be made clear with just one sentence yet would greatly help with clearing away confusions for subsequent derivations.\nAlso, \"K\" is already used to denote the mini-batch size, so it's a slight abuse to reuse \"k\" to denote the \"kth marginal\".\n\n4. In section 3.2, it may be clearer to explicitly point out the use of the \"3-sigma\" rule for Gaussian distributions here. But I don't find it justified anywhere why \"leave 99.7% of i, j pairs unpenalized\" is sth. to be sought for here?\n\n5. In section 3.3, when presenting Corollary 3.3 of Gavinsky & Pudlak (2015), \"n\" abruptly appears without proper introduction / context.\n\n6. For the empirical study with 2D MoG, would an imbalanced mixture make it harder for the BRE-regularized GAN to escape from modal collapse?\n\n7. Figure 3 is missing the sub-labels (a), (b), (c), (d).","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Improving diversity in Generative adversarial networks by encouraging discriminator representation entropy","abstract":"We propose a novel regularizer for the training of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) so that the generator can better capture the variations within the real data distribution, thus helps to avoid subtle model collapse and improve the performance of GANs.

The regularizer rewards high entropy in the signs of discriminator activations. Experiments show that this helps to prevent mode collapse on synthetic Gaussian mixture data and improves Inception scores on CIFAR10. \n\nThe high-level idea of guiding model capacity by rewarding high-entropy activations  is interesting and novel to my knowledge (though I am not an expert in this space). Figure `1 is a fantastic illustration that presents the core idea very clearly. That said I found the intuitive story a little bit difficult to follow -- it's true that in Figure 1b the discriminator won't communicate the detailed structure of the data manifold to the generator, but it's not clear why this would be a problem -- the gradients should still pull the generator *towards* the manifold of real data, and as this happens and the manifolds begin to overlap, the discriminator will naturally be forced to allocate its capacity towards finer-grained details. Is the implicit assumption that for real, high-dimensional data the generator and data manifolds will *never* overlap? But in that case much of the theoretical story goes out the window. I'd also appreciate further discussion of the relationship of this approach to Wasserstein GANs, which also attempt to provide a clearer training gradient when the data and generator manifolds do not overlap.\n\nMore generally I'd like to better understand what effect we'd expect this regularizer to have. It appears to be motivated by improving training dynamics, which is understandably a significant concern. Does it also change the location of the Nash equilibria? (or equivalently, the optimal generator under the density-ratio-estimator interpretation of discriminators proposed by https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03483). I'd expect that it would but the effects of this changed objective are not discussed in the paper. \n\n The experimental results seem promising, although not earthshattering. I would have appreciated a comparison to other methods for guiding discriminator representation capacity, e.g. autoencoding (I'd also imagine that learning an inference network (e.g. BiGAN) might serve as a useful auxiliary task?). \n\nOverall this feels like an cute hack, supported by plausible intuition but without deep theory or compelling results on real tasks (yet). As such I'd rate it as borderline; though perhaps interesting enough to be worth presenting and discussing.\n\nA final note: this paper was difficult to read due to many grammatical errors and unclear or misleading constructions, as well as missing citations (e.g. sec 2.1). From the second paragraph alone:\n\"impede their wider applications in new data domain\" -> domains\n\"extreme collapse and heavily oscillation\" -> heavy oscillation\n\"modes of real data distribution\" -> modes of the real data distribution\n\"while D fails to exploit the failure to provide better training signal to G\" -> should be \"this failure\" to refer to the previously-described generator mode collapse, or rewrite entirely\n\"even when they are their Jensen-Shannon divergence\" -> even when their Jensen-Shannon divergence\n I'm sympathetic to the authors who are presumably non-native English speakers; many good papers contain mistakes, but in my opinion the level in this paper goes beyond what is appropriate for published work. I encourage the authors to have the work proofread by a native speaker; clearer writing will ultimately increase the reach and impact of the paper.  \n","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Improving diversity in Generative adversarial networks by encouraging discriminator representation entropy","abstract":"We propose a novel regularizer for the training of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) so that the generator can better capture the variations within the real data distribution, thus helps to avoid subtle model collapse and improve the performance of GANs.
