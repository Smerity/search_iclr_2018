You’re right that there is a subtle difference between the two approaches. To paraphrase your comment, the WGAN equivalent with Cramer distance would have a critic that learns the function f* itself (Equation 4).\n\nOne resulting difference is that if we stop training the WGAN critic, the WGAN generator will  collapse to the single point with the maximal critic value. On the other hand, if we stop training the Cramer GAN critic, the Cramer GAN generator will learn to minimize the energy distance between the distributions of the critic outputs. The Cramer GAN generator will then learn a distribution, not a single point.\n\nYou can see in Figure 4 that WGAN is much worse if we do just one critic update per generator update. It is still helpful to train the Cramer GAN critic, to avoid ignoring information not originally present in the critic outputs."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"The Cramer Distance as a Solution to Biased Wasserstein Gradients","abstract":"The Wasserstein probability metric has received much attention from the machine learning community.

In particular, your feedback suggests it would be helpful to emphasize the empirical results currently in the appendix in order to better frame the theory.\n\nThere seems to be a misunderstanding regarding Theorem 1: our result shows that bias occurs not just in the gradients but also in the minimizer of the sample Wasserstein loss. Put another way: SGD on this loss, as an estimation procedure, is not consistent. This is fundamentally different from what occurs in ridge regression. \n\nIn the appendix we included empirical results on two domains (ordinal regression and image modelling) where we show that minimizing the sample Wasserstein loss by gradient descent leads to far worse results than when minimizing the Cramer loss, even when the results are measured in terms of the Wasserstein distance itself. While it's true that in general no distributional metric dominates the others, here we are highlighting a problem that has visible consequences.\n\nRegarding the merits of comparing to the KL divergence: we acknowledge the point, but do not completely agree. The shift in machine learning in the last years has exactly been recognizing that the KL divergence is ill-suited in many problems of current interest (generative modelling, cost-sensitive classification, reinforcement learning…).

This brings some valuable understanding for improving upon previous GANs [e.g. WGAN].

The paper starts with a discussion about desirable properties of a loss function and points out the fact that (plug-in) empirical versions of the gradient of this quantity are biased, which limits its interest, insofar as many learning techniques are based on (stochastic) gradient descent. In its current state, this argument looks artificial. Indeed, zero bias can be a desirable properties for an estimate but being biased does not prevent it from being accurate. In contrast, in many situations like ridge regression, incorporating bias permits to drastically reduce variance.It quite depends on the structural assumptions made. For this reason, the worst case result (Theorem 1) is not that informative in my opinion. As they are mainly concerned by the L_1 version of the Wasserstein distance, rather than focussing on the bias, the authors could consider the formulation in terms of inverse cumulative distribution functions in the 1-d setup and the fact that the empirical cdf is never invertible: even if the theoretical cdf is invertible (which naturally guarantees uniqueness of the optimal transport) the underlying mass transportation problem is not as well-posed as that related to its statistical counterpart (however, smoothing the empirical distribution may remedy this issue).\nThe authors propose to use instead the Cramer distance, which is a very popular distance in Statistics and on which many statistical hypothesis testing procedures rely, and review its appealing properties. The comparisons between KL, Wasserstein and Cramer distances is vain in my opinion and willing to come to a general conclusion about the merits of one against the others is naive. In a nonparametric setup, it is always possible to find distributions such that certain of its properties are hidden by certain distances and highlighted by others. This is precisely why you are forced to specify the type of deviations between distributions in nonparametric hypothesis testing (a shift, a change in scale, etc.), there is no way of assessing universally that two distributions are close: optimality can only be assessed for sequences of contiguous hypotheses. The choice of the distance is part of the learning problem.

Cramer distance is a Bregman divergence and is a member of the Lp family of divergences.  Here a \"distance\" means a symmetric divergence measure that satisfies the relaxed triangle inequality. The motivation for using the Cramer distance is that it has unbiased sample gradients while still enjoying some other properties such as scale sensitivity and sum invariant. The authors also proof that for the Bernoulli distribution, there is a lower bound independent of the sample size for the deviation between the gradient of the Cramer distance, and the expectation of the estimated gradient of the Cramer distance. Then, the multivariate case of the Cramer distance, called the energy distance, is also briefly presented. The paper closes with some experiments on ordinal regression using neural networks and training GANs using the Cramer distance. \n\nIn general, the manuscript is well written and the ideas are smoothly presented. While the manuscript gives some interesting insights, I find that the contribution could have been explained in a more broader sense, with a stronger compelling message.\n\nSome remarks and questions:\n\n1.\tThe KL divergence considered here is sum invariant but not scale sensitive, and has unbiased sample gradients. The \n\tauthors are considering here the standard (asymmetric) KL divergence (sec. 2.1). Is it the case that losing scale\n\tsensitivity make the KL divergence insensitive to the geometry of the outcomes? or is it due to the fact the KL \n\tdivergence is not symmetric? or ?\n\n2.\tThe main argument for the paper is that the simple sample-based estimate for the gradient using the Wasserstein \n\tmetric is a biased estimate for the true gradient of the Wasserstein distance, and hence it is not favored with\n\tSGD-type algorithms. Are there any other estimators in the literature for the gradient of the Wasserstein distance?\n\tWas this issue overlooked in the literature?\n\n3.\tI am not sure if a biased estimate for the gradient will lead to a ``wrong minimum'' in an energy space that has \n\tinfinitely many local minima.  Of course one should use an unbiased estimate for the gradient whenever this is possible.\n\tHowever, even when this is possible, there is no guarantee that this will consistently lead to deeper and ``better''\n\tminima, and there is no guarantee as well that these deep local minima reflect meaningful results.\n\n4.\tTo what extent can one generalize theorem 1 to other probability distributions (continuous and discrete) and to the \n\tmultivariate cases as well?\n\n5.\tI also don't think that the example given in sec. 4.2 and depicted in Fig. 1 is the best and simplest way to illustrate\n\tthe benefit of Cramer distance over Wasserstein. Similarly, the experiments for the multivariate case using GANs and\n\tNeural Networks do not really deliver tangible, concrete and conclusive results. Partly, these results are very  \n       qualitative, which can be understood within the context of GANs. However, the authors could have used other       \n       models/algorithms where they can obtain concrete quantitative results (for this type of contribution).
