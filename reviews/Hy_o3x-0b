The modifications are: (1) a shared en/decoder parametrization as used in the Ladder VAE [1], (2) the latent variable parameters are functions of a CNN, and (3) use of a PixelCNN decoder [2] that is fed both the last layer of stochastic variables and the input image, as done in [3].  Negative log likelihood (NLL) results on CIFAR 10, binarized MNIST (dynamic and static), OMNIGLOT, and ImageNet (32x32) are reported.  Samples are shown for CIFAR 10, MNIST, and OMNIGLOT.        \n\n\nEvaluation\n\nPros:  The paper’s primary contribution is experimental: SOTA results are achieved for nearly every benchmark image dataset (the exception being statically binarized MNIST, which is only .28 nats off).  This experimental feat is quite impressive, and moreover, in the comments on OpenReview, Yoon Kim claims to have replicated the CIFAR result.  I commend the authors for making their code available already via DropBox.  Lastly, I like how the authors isolated the effect of the concatenation via the ‘FAME No Concatenation’ results.                 \n\nCons:  The paper provides little novelty in terms of model or algorithmic design, as using a CNN to parametrize the latent variables is the only model detail unique to this paper.  In terms of experiments, the CIFAR samples look a bit blurry for the reported NLL (as others have mentioned in the OpenReview comments).  I find the authors’ claim that FAME is performing superior global modeling interesting.  Is there a way to support this experimentally?  Also, I would have liked to see results w/o the CNN parametrization; how important was this choice?  \n\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the paper's conceptual novelty is low, the engineering and experimental work required (to combine the three ideas discussed in the summary and evaluate the model on every benchmark image dataset) is commendable.  I recommend the paper’s acceptance for this reason.\n\n\n[1]  C.

From the paper it is very difficult to make out exactly what architecture is proposed. I understand that the prior on the z_i in each layer is a pixel-cnn, but what is the posterior? Equations 8 and 9 would suggest it is of the same form (pixel-cnn) but this would be much too slow to sample during training. I'm guessing it is just a factorized Gaussian, with a separate factorized Gaussian pseudo-prior? That is, in figure 1 all solid lines are factorized Gaussians and all dashed lines are pixel-cnns?\n\n* The word \"layers\" is sometimes used to refer to latent variables z, and sometimes to parameterized neural network layers in the encoder and decoder. E.g. \"The top stochastic layer z_L in FAME is a fully-connected dense layer\". No, z_L is a vector of latent variables. Are you saying the encoder produces it using a fully-connected layer?\n* Section 2.2 starts talking about \"deterministic layers h\". Are these part of the encoder or decoder? What is meant by \"number of layers connecting the stochastic latent variables\"?\n* Section 2.3: What is meant by \"reconstruction data\"?\n\nIf my understanding of the method is correct, the novelty is limited. Autoregressive priors were used previously in e.g. the Lossy VAE by Chen et al. and IAF-VAE by Kingma et al. The reported likelihood results are very impressive though, and would be reason for acceptance if correct. However, the quality of the sampled images shown for CIFAR-10 doesn't match the reported likelihood. There are multiple possible reasons for this, but after skimming the code I believe it might be due to a faulty implementation of the variational lower bound. Instead of calculating all quantities in the log domain, the code takes explicit logs and exponents and stabilizes them by adding small quantities \"eps\": this is not guaranteed to give the right result. Please fix this and re-run your experiments. (I.e. in _loss.py don't use x/(exp(y)+eps) but instead use x*exp(-y). Don't use log(var+eps) with var=softplus(x), but instead use var=softplus(x)+eps or parameterize the variance directly in the log domain).","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Feature Map Variational Auto-Encoders","abstract":"There have been multiple attempts with variational auto-encoders (VAE) to learn powerful global representations of complex data using a combination of latent stochastic variables and an autoregressive model over the dimensions of the data.

The numbers in the tables are good but I have several comments on the motivation, originality and experiments.\n\nMost parts of the paper provide a detailed review of the literature. However, the resulting model is quite like a combination of the existing advances and the main contribution of the paper, i.e. the convolution stochastic layer, is not well discussed. Why should we introduce the convolution stochastic layers? Could the layers encode the spatial information better than a deterministic convolutional layer with the same architecture? What's the exact challenge of training VAEs addressed by the convolution stochastic layer? Please strengthen the motivation and originality of the paper.\n\nThough the results are good, I still wonder what is the exact contribution of the convolutional stochastic layers to the NLL results?  Can the authors provide some results without the ladder variational posterior and the PixelCNN decoder on both the gray-scaled and the natural images?\n\nAccording to the experimental setting in the Section 3 (Page 5 Paragraph 2), \"In case of gray-scaled images the stochastic latent layers are dense with sizes 64, 32, 16, 8, 4 (equivalent to Sønderby et al. (2016)) and for the natural images they are spatial (cf. Table 1). There was no significant difference when using feature maps (as compared to dense layers) for modelling gray-scaled images.\" there is no stochastic convolutional layer.  Then is there anything new in FAME on the gray images? Furthermore, how could FAME advance the previous state-of-the-art? It seems because of other factors instead of the stochastic convolutional layer. \n\nThe results on the natural images are not complete. Please present the generation results on the ImageNet dataset and the reconstruction results on both the CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets. The quality of the samples on the CIFAR10 dataset seems not competitive to the baseline papers listed in the table. Though the visual quality does not necessarily agree with the NLL results but such large gap is still strange. Besides, why FAME can obtain both good NLL and generation results on the MNIST and OMNIGLOT datasets when there is no stochastic convolutional layer? Meanwhile, why FAME cannot obtain good generation results on the CIFAR10 dataset? Is it because there is a lot randomness in the stochastic convolutional layer? It is better to provide further analysis and it is not safe to say that the stochastic convolutional layer helps learn better latent representations based on only the NNL results.\n\nMinor things:\n\nPlease rewrite the sentence \"When performing reconstructions during training ... while also using the stochastic latent variables z = z 1 , ..., z L.\" in the caption of Figure 1.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Feature Map Variational Auto-Encoders","abstract":"There have been multiple attempts with variational auto-encoders (VAE) to learn powerful global representations of complex data using a combination of latent stochastic variables and an autoregressive model over the dimensions of the data.

We have taken the comments seriously and thoroughly reviewed the code without finding any bugs. We have retrained the models and are confident in the results given in the Tables. We actually also found slight improvements compared to the results reported.\n\nFirst of all we would like to answer the questions formulated on the 1st of November by anonymous:\n\nQ1. The Omniglot samples in Figure 4 don't look binary. Are you showing the probabilities instead of the actual samples? Which version of the Omniglot dataset did you use and how did you preprocess it?\n\nYes, we are showing the probabilities. We will include the stochastically binarized samples in the revised version. Unfortunately it is not possible to include them in this OpenReview format, so please see: https://imgur.com/gallery/NRvxO. From the plots we can see comparable results to VLAE. It is hard to distinguish whether one is better over the other by only evaluating the samples, hence the log-likelihood results in the tables should tell the full story.\n\nQ2. The MNIST samples in Figure 4 do look binary, but their edges are far too smooth for stochastically binarized MNIST. In other words, they don't actually look like the data: just compare them to samples on Figure 1 in the VLAE paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02731). Did you sample each pixel or did you just use the most probable value?\n\nYou are right, we used the most probable value. We will include the stochastically binarized samples in the revised version. Find them here: https://imgur.com/gallery/NRvxO .\n\nQ3. The CIFAR10 samples in Figure 2 have very little local detail and are not nearly sharp and structured enough to correspond to the 2.75 bits/dim result reported in the paper. In my experience, a model generating samples like this should get 3.4 bits/dim at best. What kind of test NLL estimates do you get with a single sample on CIFAR10 and ImageNet?\n\nWe do agree that these samples do not have as much local detail as the samples in VLAE and PixelCNN++. However, we have a very simple PixelCNN parameterization without the R->G->B dependency and all of the additional contributions as the PixelCNN++/VLAE papers have. In our approach the local structure is worse but the global modeling is better. We interpret the better test likelihood score as a sign that visual appeal is not the ultimate way to judge the model. We expect that including a better autoregressive model in FAME will give us the best of both worlds.\n\nFor the camera-ready version we will train FAME with a more complex autoregressive model and visualize the generated images in the final paper for both ImageNet and CIFAR10. We didn't do this experiment, since we did not have the time before the deadline and we were more interested in answering the question to why the additional VAE parameterization in PixelVAE and VLAE didn't give a better bound.\n\nLast but not least we will publish the code on Github upon publishing the paper.\n\n\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":2,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Feature Map Variational Auto-Encoders","abstract":"There have been multiple attempts with variational auto-encoders (VAE) to learn powerful global representations of complex data using a combination of latent stochastic variables and an autoregressive model over the dimensions of the data.

Are you showing the probabilities instead of the actual samples? Which version of the Omniglot dataset did you use and how did you preprocess it?\n\nThe MNIST samples in Figure 4 do look binary, but their edges are far too smooth for stochastically binarized MNIST. In other words, they don't actually look like the data: just compare them to samples on Figure 1 in the VLAE paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02731). Did you sample each pixel or did you just use the most probable value?\n\nThe CIFAR10 samples in Figure 2 have very little local detail and are not nearly sharp and structured enough to correspond to the 2.75 bits/dim result reported in the paper. In my experience, a model generating samples like this should get 3.4 bits/dim at best. What kind of test NLL estimates do you get with a single sample on CIFAR10 and ImageNet?\n\nFinally, given that you seem to have the best 32x32 ImageNet result by a huge margin it seems odd not to include any samples from this model. Why did you omit them? While sample quality is just one aspect of model performance, in my experience a large discrepancy between sample quality and NLL in a VAE-like model usually means that there's a bug in the code."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Feature Map Variational Auto-Encoders","abstract":"There have been multiple attempts with variational auto-encoders (VAE) to learn powerful global representations of complex data using a combination of latent stochastic variables and an autoregressive model over the dimensions of the data.
