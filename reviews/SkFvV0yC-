The ideas are rather simple, but could be potentially important for improving the performance of the networks. On the other hand, it seems that an important part of the work has already been done before (in particular Wei et al. 2016), and that the differences from there are very ad-hoc and intuition for why they work is not present. Instead, the paper justifies its approach by arguing that the experimental results are good. Personally, I am skeptical with that, because interesting ideas with great added value usually have some cool intuition behind them. The paper is easy to read, and there does not seem to exist major errors. Because I am not an active researcher in the topic, I cannot judge if the benefits that are shown in the experiments are enough for publication (the theoretical part is not the strongest of the paper).","confidence":"2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Network Iterative Learning for Dynamic Deep Neural Networks via Morphism","abstract":"In this research, we present a novel learning scheme called network iterative learning for deep neural networks.

Overall, the idea looks interesting and the manuscript is well-written. The shown experimental results should be able to validate the effectiveness of the learning scheme to some extent.\n\nIt would be more convincing to include the performance evaluation of the learning scheme in some representative applications, since the optimality of the training objective function is not necessarily the same as that of the trained network in the application of interest.\n\nBelow are two minor issues:\n\n- In page 2, it is stated that Fig. 2(e) illustrates the idea of the proposed network iterative learning scheme for deep neural networks based on network morphism. However, the idea seems not clear from Fig. 2(e).\n\n- In page 4, “such network iterative learning process” should be “such a network iterative learning process”.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Network Iterative Learning for Dynamic Deep Neural Networks via Morphism","abstract":"In this research, we present a novel learning scheme called network iterative learning for deep neural networks.
