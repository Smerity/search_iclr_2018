My original review said \"the proposed method is *fundamentally* a combination of prior work\" --- in that the underlying ideas had been introduced before in prior work (dropout & shake shake), not that the proposed method involved literally applying a combination of dropout and shake shake. As the paper notes, shake shake and dropout come out to be special cases of the proposed method (if one chose b_l to always be 0 with probability 1, or if one chose alpha to be = 0). My point was that the framework can be seen as a combination of the underlying mechanisms in both.\n\n2. Attenuation = weighting by alpha. This would be shake shake (where the residual path is just weighted by alpha that is uniformly distributed in some range, rather than the proposed method where the attenuation/weighting is only applied if the randomly sampled bernoulli variable is 1).\n--\n\nThe proposed method is easy to understand, and the new experiments are certainly welcome (although, I think the evaluation remains unconvincing without experiments on a large scale task such as Imagenet). However, I just don't think the contribution is novel enough to be accepted as a paper at ICLR.

But, it is not what we did. In the proposed ShakeDrop, we used ResDrop in a different usage from the usual. ResDrop is not used for dropping some layers as in the original paper. Instead, the mechanism of ResDrop is used as a probabilistic switch of two networks. We show in the paper that such usage of ResDrop contributes to stabilize a network hard to train.

Furthermore, in the revised paper, we present how the problem is not trivial and greater details about our interesting findings.\n(2) While this is not a clear error, we are afraid that we cannot get which method you mean by saying “choosing simply a random attenuation for every sample” of the following sentence: “The paper contends that this achieves superior performance than choosing simply a random attenuation for every sample (although, this can be seen as choosing an attenuation under a distribution with some fixed probability mass at 1).“\n\nWe found your comments are reasonable. So, based on your comments, we extended experiments in two aspects in the revised paper.\n(1) The proposed ShakeDrop has been successfully applied to ResNet (EraseReLU version), Wide ResNet (with batch normalization added in the end of residual blocks) and ResNeXt (EraseReLU version) since we found that batch normalization is required to be at the end of residual blocks.\n(2) In addition to CIFAR-10/100 datasets, we confirm the effectiveness of the proposed ShakeDrop through experiments on Tiny ImageNet dataset.

Based on your feedback, we substantially improved the paper.\nWe believe that our contribution is not limited to achieving the state of the art of CIFAR-10/100 but also providing interesting insight to the community.\n\nFirst of all, we would like to point out a factual error which might be caused by our paper quality.\nRegarding the novelty, we understand that the reviewer regards the proposed ShakeDrop as a simple combination of two methods (ResDrop and Shake-Shake). Though apparently it could be seen like that, it is not true. To clarify it, we enumerate what we contribute for proposing ShakeDrop.\n(1) As Shake-Shake does not work on a single residual branch, we proposed a new regularization method working on a single residual branch (used in the intermediate method (“1-branch Shake”; previously we called it PyramidShake)). While it is inspired by Shake-Shake, it is completely different one.\n(2) We used ResDrop in a different usage from the usual. In the original paper, ResDrop is used for dropping some layers. Instead, we used it as a switch of two networks. We demonstrated in the paper that such usage of ResDrop contributes to stabilize a network hard to train like “1-branch Shake.”\n\nThe following are responses to negative aspects of the paper in your comments.\n\n1. Motivation\nAt the time of the initial submission, our motivation was to propose an effective and memory efficient regularization method applicable to PyramidNet because PyramidNet was the best network architecture on CIFAR-10/100 datasets.\nAfter reading review comments, we slightly updated our motivation. That is, in the revised paper, the target network architectures are not only PyramidNet but also ResNet, Wide ResNet and ResNext.\nThough the negative forward weight could be sensational, it is not our central contribution (we explained in the revised manuscript into greater detail). We added consideration on why the negative forward weight works well on the proposed ShakeDrop.\n\n2. Experiments on different datasets\nIt is understandable reaction to request experiments on different datasets. We added experiments on Tiny ImageNet dataset. While we understand experiments on ImageNet dataset are better, we found it is not possible to complete them in time with our computational resources.\n \n3. Memory issue of Shake-Shake\nIt seems our explanation was not appropriate. As we responded to the post by the author of Shake-Shake, out intention is not taking into account only learnable parameters but the total memory consumption.\n\nAnyway, out intention is as follows (as is written in the revised paper). Shake-Shake is designed to take a weighted sum of outputs of two residual branches. So, it requires at least two branches in a layer to apply. Due to this, it can be applied only to ResNeXt (having multiple branches) and it requires more memory to make the network deep than networks with a single residual branch in a layer.\n\n4. Writing quality\nWe are very sorry about it. We tried our best to correct such issues.\n\nRespond to “Smaller comments”\n- (alpha negative, beta positive) and (alpha positive, beta negative) are conceptually same?\nIt is a reaction we expected. The answer is no. We tried our best to explain this in the revised paper.\n\n- End of section 4.1, should it be b_l as p_L is a constant and b_l is what is sampled?\nThanks for pointing this out. It is a typo. It should have been b_l.\n\n- Exactly the same text is repeated 3 times\nWe are sorry for this. It is also solved in the revised paper.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"ShakeDrop regularization","abstract":"This paper proposes a powerful regularization method named \\textit{ShakeDrop regularization}.\nShakeDrop is inspired by Shake-Shake regularization that decreases error rates by disturbing learning.\nWhile Shake-Shake can be applied to only ResNeXt which has multiple branches, ShakeDrop can be applied to not only ResNeXt but also ResNet, Wide ResNet and PyramidNet in a memory efficient way.\nImportant and interesting feature of ShakeDrop is that it strongly disturbs learning by multiplying even a negative factor to the output of a convolutional layer in the forward training pass.\nThe effectiveness of ShakeDrop is confirmed by experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and Tiny ImageNet datasets.\n","pdf":"/pdf/9ee17c9a4b8705ee53c2cda971bb1e0d1c4d142d.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|shakedrop_regularization","_bibtex":"@article{\n  anonymous2018shakedrop,\n  title={ShakeDrop regularization},\n  author={Anonymous},\n  journal={International Conference on Learning Representations},\n  year={2018},\n  url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1NHaMW0b}\n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1003/Authors"],"keywords":[]}},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1514970163876,"tcdate":1514970163876,"number":4,"cdate":1514970163876,"id":"BknEhzqmf","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Paper1003/Official_Comment","forum":"S1NHaMW0b","replyto":"S1NHaMW0b","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1003/Authors"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1003/Authors"],"content":{"title":"Revised paper is uploaded","comment":"We substantially improved the paper.

The procedure consists of essentially weighting the residual branch with a random weight, in the style of Shake-Shake, where the weight is sampled from a mixture of uniform distribution in [-1, 1] and delta at 1, such that the mixture of those two distributions varies linearly with layer depth, in the style of PyramidDrop. In the style of Shake-Shake, a different random weight (in [0, 1]) is used for the backward pass. The most surprising part is that that the forward weight can be negative thus inverting the output of a convolution. Apparently the goal is to \"disturb\" the training, and the procedure yields state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10/100.\n\nPositives:\n\n- Results: state-of-the-art on CIFAR-10/100\n\nNegatives:\n\n1. No real motivation on why should this work. I guess the motivation is the mixture of PyramidDrop and Shake-Shake motivations, but the main surprising part (forward weight can be negative) is not motivated at all. There is a tiny bit of discussion at the very end, section 4.4, where authors examine the training loss (showing it's non-zero so less overfitting) and mean/variance of gradients (increased). However, this doesn't really satisfy me - it is clear that more disturbance will cause this behaviour, but that doesn't mean any disturbance is good, e.g. if I always apply the negative weight and make my model weights go in the wrong direction, I'm pretty sure training loss and gradients will be even larger, but it's a bad idea to do.\n\n2. I'm concerned with the \"weird trick that happens to work on CIFAR\" line of work (not saying that this paper is the only offender) - are these methods actually useful and generalizable to other problems, or are we overfitting on CIFAR and creating MNIST v2.0 ? It would be nice to demonstrate that this regularization works in at least one more problem, maybe ImageNet, though maybe regularization is not needed there but just find one more dataset that needs regularization and test this on that.\n\n3. The paper doesn't explain well what is the problem with Shake-Shake and memory. I see that the author of Shake-Shake has made a comment on this and that makes a lot of sense, i.e. there is no memory issue, just because there are 2x branches doesn't mean shake-shake needs 2x memory as it can use less capacity=memory to achieve the same performance. So it seems the main premise of the paper - \"let's apply Shake-Shake to deeper models but we need to come up with a modified method because Shake-Shake cannot be applied due to memory problems\" - seems wrong.\n\n4. The writing quality is quite bad, it is very hard to understand what authors mean in parts of the text. E.g. at two places \"it has almost the same residual block as Eqn. (1)\" - how is it \"almost\"? Below equation 5, it is never specified that alpha and beta are sampled uniformly(?) from those ranges, one could think that alpha and beta are fixed constants that take a specific value that is in that range. There are also various grammatical errors such as \"is expected to be powerful but slight memory overhead\" or \"which is introduced essence\", etc.\n\nSmaller comments:\n- Isn't it surprising that alpha in [-1, 1] and beta in [0, 1] works well, but alpha in [0, 1] and beta in [-1, 1] works much worse? The two important cases, (alpha negative, beta positive) and (alpha positive, beta negative), seem to me like they are conceptually very similar.\n- End of section 4.1, should it be b_l as p_L is a constant and b_l is what is sampled?\n- I don't like that exactly the same text is repeated 3 times (abstract, end of intro, end of 1.1) and in very short distance from each other - repeating the same words 3 times doesn't make the reader understand it better, slight rephrasing is much more beneficial.\n\nOverall:\nGood to know that this method sets the new state of the art on CIFAR-10/100, so as such it should be of interest to the community to be available online (arXiv).

The original \"shake-shake\" proposes using two residual paths adding to the same output (so x + F_1(x) + F_2(x)), and during training, considering different randomly selected convex combinations of the two paths (while using an equally weighted combination at test time). However, this paper contends that this requires additional memory, and attempt to achieve similar regularization with a single path. To do so, they train a network with a single residual path, where the residual is included without attenuation in some cases with some fixed probability, and  attenuated randomly (or even inverted) in others. The paper contends that this achieves superior performance than choosing simply a random attenuation for every sample (although, this can be seen as choosing an attenuation under a distribution with some fixed probability mass at 1). Experiments show improved generalization on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.\n\nI don't think the paper contains sufficiently novel elements to be accepted as a conference track paper at ICLR. While it is interesting that this works well (especially the \"negative\" weight on the residual), the proposed method is fundamentally a combination of prior work: dropout and \"shake-shake\" regularization. Moreover, the evaluation is somewhat limited---essentially, I feel there isn't conclusive proof that \"shake-drop\" is a generically useful regularization technique. For one, the method is evaluated only on small toy-datasets: CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. I think at the very least, evaluation on Imagenet is necessary. The proposed regularization is applied only to the \"PyramidNet\" architecture---which begs the question of whether the proposed regularization is useful only for this specific network architecture. It would have been more useful to see results with and without \"shake-drop\" on different architectures (the point being to show a consistent improvement with this regularization, rather than achieving 'state of the art' on CIFAR-10). Moreover, it would be interesting to see if the hyperparameter comparison shown in Tables 1 and 2 remained consistent across architectures.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"ShakeDrop regularization","abstract":"This paper proposes a powerful regularization method named \\textit{ShakeDrop regularization}.\nShakeDrop is inspired by Shake-Shake regularization that decreases error rates by disturbing learning.\nWhile Shake-Shake can be applied to only ResNeXt which has multiple branches, ShakeDrop can be applied to not only ResNeXt but also ResNet, Wide ResNet and PyramidNet in a memory efficient way.\nImportant and interesting feature of ShakeDrop is that it strongly disturbs learning by multiplying even a negative factor to the output of a convolutional layer in the forward training pass.\nThe effectiveness of ShakeDrop is confirmed by experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and Tiny ImageNet datasets.\n","pdf":"/pdf/9ee17c9a4b8705ee53c2cda971bb1e0d1c4d142d.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|shakedrop_regularization","_bibtex":"@article{\n  anonymous2018shakedrop,\n  title={ShakeDrop regularization},\n  author={Anonymous},\n  journal={International Conference on Learning Representations},\n  year={2018},\n  url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1NHaMW0b}\n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1003/Authors"],"keywords":[]}},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1511791041135,"tcdate":1511791041135,"number":2,"cdate":1511791041135,"id":"r1F6F5Ygf","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Paper1003/Official_Comment","forum":"S1NHaMW0b","replyto":"S1rHOM-gz","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1003/Authors"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1003/Authors"],"content":{"title":"Reply to \"Memory issue clarification\"","comment":"Roughly speaking, Shake-Shake requires as twice the amount of memory as ResNet on a residual block due to twice the number of residual branches.
