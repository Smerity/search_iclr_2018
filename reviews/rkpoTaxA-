With a view to addressing your concerns, we have run further experiments to quantify the effects of each part of our approach - including data augmentation - for all of the small image benchmarks. We have therefore removed Table 2 as the information that it presented can be more compactly shown in Table 1, alongside everything else. We have added further discussion of the effect of our affine augmentation to section 3.3 and demonstrated its effect on both domain adaptation and plain supervised experiments. What we currently have is the same augmentation scheme used by Lain et al. and Tarvainen at al, which consists of translations (all) and horizontal flips (CIFAR/STL only). Experiments with minimal augmentation (gaussian noise added to the input only, therefore usable outside the image domain) are currently running; we will add them if the experiments complete on time.\n\nFurthermore, we found that our model performs slightly better on the MNIST <-> SVHN experiments when using RGB images rather than greyscale, so we have replaced our greyscale results with RGB ones. This represents a slightly bigger domain jump, so we hope that this increases your confidence in our work.\n\n* We see what you mean concerning engineering tricks. In defence of confidence thresholding, rather than being a new additional trick it replaces a time-dependent ramp-up curve used by Laine et al. in their work. We have made this a little more explicit in section 3.3. As for class balancing loss, it is similar in purpose and implementation to the entropy maximisation loss used in the IMSAT model of Hu et al. (an unsupervised clustering model that also uses data augmentation). We have mentioned this in section 3.4. We did not cite this paper in our original version as we were unaware of it at the time.\n\n* We have run further VisDA experiments. We found that pairing back our augmentation scheme improved performance on the validation set and made little different on the test set. Our original complex augmentation scheme was tested on a very small subset (1280 samples) of the training and validation sets during the development of our model. It turns out that these results did not generalise to the full set, so lesson learned (we were facing a tight competition deadline too). Our new reduced augmentation scheme consists of random crops, random horizontal flips and random uniform scaling, thus bringing it in line with augmentation schemes commonly used in ImageNet networks, such as He et al.'s ResNets. We have also performed 5 independent runs of each of our newer experiments and given a breakdown of the results."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Self-ensembling for visual domain adaptation","abstract":"This paper explores the use of self-ensembling for visual domain adaptation problems.

The originality of the main method was not immediately apparent to me.

This is motivated by a similar network introduced in the context of semi-supervised learning by Tarvainen and Valpola (2017). The parameters are then optimized by gradient descent where the weight of the loss-term associated with the unsupervised learning part follows a Gaussian curve (with time).

The main idea is to enforce the agreement between the predictions of the teacher and the student classifiers on the target domain samples while training the student to perform well on the source domain. The teacher network is simply an exponential moving average of different versions of the student network over time.   \n\nPros:\n+ The paper is well-written and easy to read\n+ The proposed method is a natural extension of the mean teacher semi-supervised learning model by [Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017]\n+ The model achieves state-of-the-art results on a range of visual domain adaptation benchmarks (including top performance in the VisDA17 challenge)\n\nCons:\n- The model is tailored to the image domain as it makes heavy use of the data augmentation. That restricts its applicability quite significantly. I’m also very interested to know how the proposed method works when no augmentation is employed (for fair comparison with some of the entries in Table 1).\n- I’m not particularly fond of the engineering tricks like confidence thresholding and the class balance loss. They seem to be essential for good performance and thus, in my opinion, reduce the value of the main idea.\n- Related to the previous point, the final VisDA17 model seems to be engineered too heavily to work well on a particular dataset. I’m not sure if it provides many interesting insights for the scientific community at large.\n\nIn my opinion, it’s a borderline paper. While the best reported quantitative results are quite good, it seems that achieving those requires a significant engineering effort beyond just applying the self-ensembling idea. \n\nNotes:\n* The paper somewhat breaks the anonymity of the authors by mentioning the “winning entry in the VISDA-2017”. Maybe it’s not a big issue but in my opinion it’s better to remove references to the competition entry.\n* Page 2, 2.1, line 2, typo: “stanrdard” -> “standard”\n\nPost-rebuttal revision:\nAfter reading the authors' response to my review, I decided to increase the score by 2 points.

Our technique is derived from the mean teacher variant (Tarvainen et. al 2017) of temporal ensembling (Laine et al. 2017), a technique that achieved state of the art results in the area of semi-supervised learning.
