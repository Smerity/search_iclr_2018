It begins by observing that in time-limited domains, an agent unaware of the remaining time can experience state-aliasing. To combat this problem, the authors suggest modifying the state representation of the policy to include an indicator of the amount of remaining time. The time-aware agent shows improved performance in a time-limited gridworld and several control domains. Next, the authors consider the problem of learning a time-unlimited policy from time-limited episodes. They show that by bootstrapping from the final state of the time-limited domain, they are able to learn better policies for the time-unlimited case.\n\nPros:\nThe paper is well-written and clear, if a bit verbose. \nThe paper has extensive experiments in a variety of domains.\n\nCons:\nIn my opinion, the substance of the contribution is not enough to warrant a full paper and the problem of time-limited learning is not well motivated: \n\n1) It's not clear how frequently RL agents will encounter time-limited domains of interest. Currently most domains are terminated by failure/success conditions rather than time. The author's choice of tasks seem somewhat artificial in that they impose time limits on otherwise unlimited domains in order to demonstrate experimental improvement. Is there good reason to think RL agents will need to contend with time-limited domains in the future? \n\n2) The inclusion of remaining-time as a part of the agent's observations and resulting improvement in time-limited domains is somewhat obvious. It's well accepted that in any partially observed domain, inclusion of the latent variable(s) as a part of the agent's observation will result in a fully observed domain, less state-aliasing, more accurate value estimates, and better performance. The author's inclusion of the latent time variable as a part of the agent's observations reconfirms this well-known fact, but doesn't tell us anything new.\n\n3) I have the same questions about Partial Episode bootstrapping: Is there a task in which we find our RL agents learning in time-limited settings and then evaluated in unlimited ones? The experiments in this direction again feel somewhat contrived by imposing time limits and then removing them. The proposed solution of bootstrapping from the value of the terminal state v(S_T) clearly works, and I suspect that any RL-practitioner faced with training time-limited policies that are evaluated in time-unlimited settings might come up with the same solution. While the experiments are well done, I don't think the substance of the algorithmic improvement is enough.\n\nI think this paper would improve by demonstrating how time-aware policies can help in domains of interest (which are usually not time-limited). I could imagine a line of experiments that investigate the idea of selectively stopping episodes when the agent is no longer experiencing useful transitions, and then showing that the partial episode bootstrapping can save on overall sample complexity compared to an agent that must experience the entirety of every episode.

The first is including time remaining in the state, for domains where episodes are cut-off before a terminal state is reached in the usual way. The second idea is to allow bootstrapping at episode boundaries, but cutting off episodes to facilitate exploration. The ideas are illustrated through several well-worked micro-world experiments.\n\nOverall the paper is well written and polished. They slowly worked through a simple set of ideas trying to convey a better understanding to the reader, with a focus on performance of RL in practice.\n\nMy main issue with the paper is that these two topics are actually not new and are well covered by the existing RL formalisms. That is not to say that an empirical exploration of the practical implications is not of value, but that the paper would be much stronger if it was better positioned in the literature that exists.\n\nThe first idea of the paper is to include time-remaining in the state. This is of course always possible in the MDP formalism. If it was not done, as in your examples, the state would not be Markov and thus it would not be an MDP at all. In addition, the technical term for this is finite horizon MDPs (in many cases the horizon is taken to be a constant, H). It is not surprising that algorithms that take this into account do better, as your examples and experiments illustrate. The paper should make this connection to the literature more clear and discuss what is missing in our existing understanding of this case, to motivate your work. See Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control and references too it.\n\nThe second idea is that episodes may terminate due to time out, but we should include the discounted value of the time-out termination state in the return. I could not tell from the text but I assume, the next transition to the start state is fully discounted to zero, otherwise the value function would link the values of S_T and the next state, which I assume you do not want. The impact of this choice is S_T is no longer a termination state, and there is a direct fully discounted transition to the start states. This is in my view is how implementations of episodic tasks with a timeout should be done and is implemented this way is classic RL frameworks (e.g., RL glue). If we treat the value of S_T as zero or consider gamma on the transition into the time-out state as zero, then in cost to goal problems the agent will learn that these states are good and will seek them out leading to suboptimal behavior. The literature might not be totally clear about this, but it is very well discussed in a recent ICML paper: White 2017 [1]\n\nAnother way to pose and think about this problem is using the off-policy learning setting---perhaps best described in the Horde paper [2]. In this setting the behavior policy can have terminations and episodes in the classic sense (perhaps due to time outs). However, the agent's continuation function (gamma : S -> [0,1]) can specify weightings on states representing complex terminations (or not), completely independent of the behavior policy or actual state transition dynamics of the underlying MDP. To clearly establish your contributions, the authors must do a better job of relating their work to [1] and [2].\n\n[1] White. Unifying task specification in reinforcement learning. Martha White.
