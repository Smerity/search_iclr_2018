A rich lists of the possible components of the neural network-based clustering methods are given, that include the different neural network architectures, feature to use for clustering, loss functions used and more. In Section 3, a few methods from the literature are classified according to the proposed taxonomy. Furthermore, in Section 4 a new method is proposed, that is to combine the best parts of the already existing models in the literature. Unfortunately, the experiments is Section 5 reveal that the proposed method yields results that are at most comparable with the existing methods. \n\nThe paper is written well and provides good insights (mostly taxonomy) on the existing methods for neural network-based clustering. However, the paper lacks novel content. The novel content of the paper sums up to the proposed method, that is composed of building blocks of existing models, and fails to impress in experimental results. It could be that this paper belongs to another venue that is more appropriate for survey papers.  Also, it overall rather appears short.\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Clustering with Deep Learning: Taxonomy and New Methods","abstract":"Clustering is a fundamental machine learning method.

However, the proposed new method is lack of novelty. The experiments part also need to be improved. ","rating":"3: Clear rejection","review":"In this paper the authors give a nice review of clustering methods with deep learning and a systematic taxonomy for existing methods. Finally, the authors propose a new method by using one unexplored combination of taxonomy features.\n\nThe paper is well-written and easy to follow. The proposed combination is straightforward, but lack of novelty. From table 1, it seems that the only differences between the proposed method and DEPICK is whether the method uses balanced assignment and pretraining. I am not convinced that these changes will lead to a significant difference. The performance of the proposed method and DEPICK are also similar in table 1. \n\nIn addition, the experiments section is not comprehensive enough as well. the author only tested on two datasets. More datasets should be tested for evaluation. In addition, It seems that nearly all the experiments results from comparison methods are borrowed from the original publications. The authors should finish the experiments on comparison methods and fill the entries in Table 1.\n\nIn summary, the proposed method is lack of novelty compare to existing methods. The survey part is nice, however extensive experiments should be conducted by running existing methods on different datasets and analyzing the pros and cons of the methods and their application scenarios. Therefore, I think the paper cannot be accepted at this stage.\n","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Clustering with Deep Learning: Taxonomy and New Methods","abstract":"Clustering is a fundamental machine learning method.

Based on the review taxonomy, the authors presents a mixed objective which aims for bretter clustering performance. The proposed method is then tested on two image data sets.\n\nThe claimed main contribution of the paper is the taxonomy. There are no new things in such kind of reviews. The taxonomy gives no scientific axioms. Therefore the impact or actual contribution to the ICLR community is very limited.\n\nThe proposed clustering method is problematic. It is hard to set the paramter alpha. The experimental results are also disappointing. For example, the COIL20 accuracy is only 0.762, much worse than the state of the art. Moreover, results on only two image data sets are not sufficient for convincing.","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Clustering with Deep Learning: Taxonomy and New Methods","abstract":"Clustering is a fundamental machine learning method.
