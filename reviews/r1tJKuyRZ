We comment on a number of these remarks below, and have updated some of the corresponding points in the paper.\n\n== Major concerns of one or multiple reviewers ==\n\n* O(n^2) complexity of Gale-Shapely.\nIt is true that this complexity could, in practice, restrict the applicability of the proposed algorithm to smaller sets. However, there is a range of problems where small set sizes are relevant, e.g. when an agent interacts with an environment where one or multiple instances of an object can be present (as opposed to point cloud representations of objects)\n\nWe have included the above remark in the paper.\n\n* Synthetic data set vs. real-world data set\nWe completely agree that the paper will be much stronger once we include results on a real-world data set. However, in the limited time available, we were not able to do so just yet.\n\n* Proposal by AnonReviewer3: use the same encoder, but a plain LSTM decoder as benchmark (to show whether the Gale-Shapely-augmented decoder works better).\n(i.e., use the first $n$ outputs $o_i,i\\in{1,\\dots,n}$ directly)\n\nThis is an interesting idea, that we will have to try out. However, the current assumption is that its behavior will probably be worse: Unlike the Seq-AE, it will not be able to store ordering information in the permutation-invariant embedding, but penalize misaligned points in the output heavily.\n\n* Remarks about applicability to different problem types\n\nWe agree with the reviewers' comments about the applicability of the model (and its limitations). The purpose of using a range of problems with different properties was precisely to test this. We currently think that future work could either try to make the model more generally applicable to multiple of these problem classes, or specialize it for a specific type of problem (however, we think that it would be beyond the scope of this paper, especially when taking the page limit into account).\n\n== Minor issues raised by one or multiple reviewers ==\n* We fixed multiple smaller issues (typos/formatting) in the latest version.\n \n "},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"The Set Autoencoder: Unsupervised Representation Learning for Sets","abstract":"We propose the set autoencoder, a model for unsupervised representation learning for sets of elements.

The model utilizes the neural attention mechanism for set inputs proposed in (Vinyals et al., ICLR 2016) to encode a set into a fixed-length latent representation, and then employs an LSTM decoder to reconstruct the original set of elements, in which a stable matching algorithm is used to match decoder outputs to input elements. Experimental results on synthetic datasets show that the model learns meaningful representations and effectively handles permutation invariance.\n\nMajor Concerns:\n\n1. Although the employed Gale-Shapely algorithm facilitates permutation-invariant set reconstruction, it has O(n^2) computational complexity during each back-propagation iteration, which might prevent it from scaling to sets of fairly big sizes. \n\n2. The experiments are only evaluated on synthetic datasets, and applications of the set autoencoder to real-world applications or scientific problems will make this work more interesting and significant.\n\n3. The main contribution of this work is the adoption of the stable matching algorithm in the decoder. A strong set autoencoder baseline will be, the encoder employs the neural attention mechanism proposed in (Vinyals et al., ICLR 2016), but the decoder just uses a standard LSTM as in a seq2seq framework.

An input set is encoded into a\nfixed-length representation using an attention mechanism (previously proposed by\n[1]). The decoder generates the output sequentially and the generated sequence\nis matched to the best-matching ordering of the target output set.\nExperiments are done on synthetic datasets to demonstrate properties of the\nlearned representation.\n\nPros\n- Experiments show that the autoencoder helps improve classification accuracy\n  for small training set sizes on the shape classification task.\n- The analysis of how the decoder generates data is insightful.\n\nCons\n- The experiments are on toy datasets only. Given the availability of point\n  cloud data sets, for example, KITTI which has a widely used benchmark for\npoint cloud based object detection, it would make the paper stronger if this\nmodel was benchmarked against published baselines.\n\n- The autoencoder does not seem to help much on the regression tasks where even\n  for the smaller training set size setting, directly using the encoder to solve\nthe task often works best. Even finetuning is unable to recover from the\npretrained weights. Therefore, it seems that the decoder (which is the novel\naspect of this work) is perhaps not working well, or is not well suited to the\nregression tasks being considered.\n\n- The classification task, for which the learned representations work well\n  empirically, seems to be geared towards representing object shape. It doesn't\nreally require remembering each point. On the other hand, the regression tasks\nthat could require remembering the points don't seem to be benefit much from the\nautoencoder pretraining. This suggests that while the model is able to represent\noverall shape, it has a hard time remembering individual elements of the set.\nThis seems like a drawback, since a general \"set auto-encoder\" should be able\nto perform a wide variety of tasks on the input set which could require remembering\nthe set's elements.\n\nQuality\nThis paper describes the proposed model quite well and provides encouraging\npreliminary results.\n\nClarity\nThe paper is easy to understand.\n\nOriginality\nThe novelty in the model is using a matching algorithm to find the best ordering\nof the target output set to match with the sequentially generated decoder\noutput. However, the paper makes a choice of one ranking based matching scheme\nand does not compare to other alternatives.\n\nSignificance\nThis paper proposes a way of learning representations of sets which will be of\nbroad interest across the machine learning community. These models are likely to\nbecome more relevant with increasing prevelance of point cloud data.\n\nReferences\n[1] Oriol Vinyals, Samy Bengio, and Manjunath Kudlur.

If not, it would be useful to underline the differences.\n\nThe decoder, on the other hand, is different and relies on a loss that is based on an heuristic to find the current best order (based on an ordering, or mapping W, found using the Gale-Shapely algorithm). Does this mean that Algorithm 1 needs to be run for every training (and test) example? if so, it is important to note what is the effective complexity of running it?\n\nThe experimental section is interesting, but in the end a bit disappointing: although a new artificial dataset is proposed to evaluate sets, it is unclear how different are the findings from those in the \"Order Matters\" paper:\n- the first set of results (in Section 4.1) confirms that the set encoder is important (which was also in the other paper I believe)\n- the second set of results (Section 4.2) shows that in some cases, an auto-encoder is also useful: this is mostly the case when the supervised data is small compared to the availability of a much larger unsupervised data (of sets). This is interesting (and novel compared to the \"Order Matters\" paper) but corresponds to known findings from most previous work on semi-supervised learning: pre-training is only useful when only a very small supervised data exists, and quickly becomes irrelevant.
