The images are generated synthetically by plotting perturbed sampled data using a visualization tool. The questions are also generated synthetically using 15 templates. Performance of baseline models and humans show that it is a challenging task and more advanced models are required to solve this task.\n\nStrengths:\n— FigureQA can help in developing models that can extract useful information from visual representations of data.\n— Since performance on CLEVR dataset is already close to 100%, more challenging visual reasoning datasets would encourage the community to develop more advanced reasoning models. One of such datasets can be FigureQA.\n— The paper is well written and easy to follow.\n\n\nWeaknesses:\n— Since the dataset is created synthetically, it is not clear if it is actually visual reasoning which is needed to solve this task, or the models can exploit biases (not necessarily language biases) to perform well on this dataset. In short, how do we know if the models trained on this dataset are actually learning something useful? One way to ensure this would be to show that models trained on this dataset can perform well on some other task. The first thing to try to show the usefulness of FigureQA is to show that the models trained on FigureQA dataset perform well on a real (figure, QA) dataset.\n— The only advantages mentioned in the paper of using a synthetic dataset for this task are having greater control over task’s complexity and enabling auxiliary supervision signals, but none of them are shown in this paper, so it’s not clear if they are needed or useful.\n— The paper should discuss what type of abilities are required in the models to perform well on this task, and how these abilities are currently not studied in the research community. Or in short, what new challenges are being introduced by FigureQA and how should researchers go about solving them on a high level?\n— With what goal were these 15 types of questions chosen? Are these the most useful questions analysts want to extract out of plots? I am especially concerned about finding the roughest/smoothest and low/high median. Even humans are relatively bad at these tasks. Why do we expect models to do well on them?\n— Why only binary questions? It is probably more difficult for analysts to ask a binary question than to ask non-binary ones such as “What is the highest in this plot?” — Why these 5 types of plots? Can the authors justify that these 5 types of plots are the most frequent ones dealt by analysts?\n— Are the model accuracies in Table 3 on the same subset as humans or on the complete test set? Can the authors please report both separately?\n\n\nOverall: \nThe proposed dataset seems reasonable but neither the dataset seems properly motivated (something where analysts actually struggle and models can help) nor it is clear if it will actually be useful for the research community (models performing well on this dataset will need to focus on specific abilities which have not been studied in the research community).","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"FigureQA: An Annotated Figure Dataset for Visual Reasoning","abstract":"We introduce FigureQA, a visual reasoning corpus of over one million question-answer pairs grounded in over 100,000 images.

The questions involve reasoning about figure elements (e.g., “Is X minimum?”, “Does X have maximum area under curve?”, where X refers to an element in a figure). The images are synthetic and the questions are templated. The dataset consists of over 100,000 images and the questions are from 15 templates. The authors also provide the numerical data associated with each figure and bounding box annotations for all plot elements. The paper trains and evaluates three baselines – question only LSTM, CNN + LSTM and Relation Networks on the proposed FigureQA dataset. The experimental results show that Relation Networks outperform the other two baselines, but still ~30% behind human performance.\n\nStrengths:\n1.\tThe proposed task is a useful task for building intelligent AI agents.\n2.\tThe writing of the paper is clear with enough details about the data generation process.\n3.\tThe idea of using different compositions of color and figure during train and test is interesting.\n4.\tThe baselines experimented with in the paper make sense.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1.\tThe motivation behind the proposed task needs to be better elaborated.

The images are synthetic scientific style figures and questions are generated from 15 templates which concern various relationships between plot elements. The authors experiment with the proposed dataset with 3 baselines. Text-only baseline, which only considers the questions; CNN+LSTM baseline, which does a late fusion between image and question representation; Relation Network, which follows Santoro et al. (2017). Experiment results show that the proposed task poses a difficult challenge where CNN+LSTM baseline only 2% better than guessing (50%) and relation network which takes spatial reasoning into consideration, performs better on this task (61.54%). \n\n[Strenghts]\n\nThe proposed Figure QA dataset is a first step towards developing models that can recognize the visual representation of data. This is definitely a novel area that requires the machine not only understand the corpus, but also the scientific figure associated with the figure. Traditional VQA methods not working well on the proposed dataset, only 2% better than guessing (50%). The proposed dataset requires the machine understand the spatial arrangement of the object and reason the relations between them.  \n\n[Weaknesses]\n\n1: There are no novel algorithms associated with this dataset. CVPR seems a better place to publish this paper, but I'm open to ICLR accept dataset paper.\n\n2: The generated templated questions of proposed FigureQA dataset is very constraint.  All the question is the binary question, and there is no variation of the template with respect to the same question type. Most of the question type can be represented as a triplet. In this sense, the proposed dataset requires less language understanding compare to previous synthesis dataset such as CLEVER. \n\n3: Since the generated question is very templated and less variational, a traditional hand-crafted approach may perform much better compared to the end-to-end approach. The paper didn't have any baseline for the hand-crafted approach, thus we don't know how it performs on the proposed dataset, and whether more advanced neural approaches are needed for this dataset. \n\n[Summary]\n\nThis paper introduces a new dataset called FigureQA, which answering the synthetic scientific style figures given the 15 type of questions. The authors experiment the proposed dataset with 3 neural baselines: Question only, LSTM + CNN and relational network. The proposed dataset is the first step towards developing models that can recognize the visual representation of data. However, my major concern about this dataset is the synthesized question is very templated and less variational. From the example, it seems it does not require natural language understanding of the dataset. Triplet representation seems enough to represent the most type of the question. The authors also didn't conduct hand-crafted baselines, which can provide a better intuition about the difficulty lies in the proposed dataset. Taking all these into account, I suggest accepting this paper if the authors could provide more justification on the question side of the proposed dataset.
