To accommodate different goal stacking states the authors extend the state representation of DQN. The input to the network is the current state of the environment as represented by the 2d projection of the objects in the simulated grid world and a representation of the goal state in the same projection space. The reward function in its basic form rewards only the correctly finished model. A number of heuristics are used to augment this reward function so as to provide shaping rewards along the way and speed up learning. The learnt policy is evaluated on the successful assembly of the target stack and on a distance measure between the stack specified as goal and the actual stack. \n\nCurrently, I don’t understand from the manuscript, how DQN is actually trained. Are all different tasks used on a single network? If so, is it surprising that the network performs worse than when augmenting the state representation with the goal? Or are separate DQNs trained for multiple tasks?\n\nThe definition of value function at the bottom of page 4 uses the definition for continual tasks but in the current setting the tasks are naturally episodic.

Even just including stable scenes, I estimated based on Figure 5 that there must be about 70 different configurations that are stable (and this is likely an underestimate). So, if each of these scenes occurs equally often and the vanilla DQN agent does not receive any information about the target goal and just acts based on an \"average\" policy, I would expect it to only achieve success about 1/70th of the time. Am I missing something here?\n\nAnother thing that was unclear to me is how the rotation of the blocks is chosen: is the agent given the next block with the correct rotation, or can it also choose to rotate the block? In the text it is implied that the only actions are {left, right, down}, which seems to simplify the task immensely. It would be interesting to include results where the agent additionally has to choose from actions of {rotate left by 90 degrees, rotate right by 90 degrees}.\n\nAlso: are the scenes used during testing separate from those used during training? If not, it's not obvious that the agent isn't just learning to memorize the solution (which somewhat defeats the idea behind parameterizing the Q-network with new goals every time).\n\nOriginality and Significance:\n\nThe block-stacking task is very cool and is more complex than many other physics-based RL tasks in the literature, which often involve just stacking square blocks in a single tower. I think it is a useful contribution to introduce this task and the GDQN agent as a baseline. However, the notion of parameterizing the policy by the goal state is not particularly novel. While it is true that many RL papers do train to optimize just a single reward function for a single goal, it is also very straightforward to modify the state space to include a goal and indeed [1-4] are just a few examples of recent papers that have done this. In general, any time there is a procedurally generated environment (e.g. Sokoban, as in [5]) the goal necessarily is included as part of the state space---so the idea of GDQN isn't really that new.\n\n[1] Oh, J., Singh, S., Lee, H., & Kohli, P.

They use end-to-end deep reinforcement learning - the DQN model - including the task goal as an input in order to to improve generalization over several tasks, and shaping the reward depending on the visual differences between the goal state and the current state. They show that the task performance of their model is better than the DQN on two simulated tasks.\nThe paper is well-written, clarity is good, it could be slightly improved by updating the title \"Toy example with Goal integration\" to make it consistent with the naming \"navigation task\" used elsewhere.\n\nIf the proposed model is new given the reviewer's knowledge, the contribution is small. The biggest change compared to the DQN model is the addition of information in the input.\nThe authors initially claim that \"In this paper, [they] study how an artificial agent can autonomously acquire this intuition through interaction with the environment\", however the proposed tasks present little to no realistic physical interaction: the navigation task is a toy problem where no physics is simulated. In the stacking task, only part of the simulation actually use the physical simulation result. Given that machine learning methods are in general good at finding optimal policies that exploit simulation limitations, this problem seems a threat to the significance of this work.\n\nThe proposed GDQN model shows better performance than the DQN model. However, as the authors do not provide in-depth analysis of what the network learns (e.g. by testing policies in the absence of an explicit goal), it is difficult to judge if the network learnt a meaningful representation of the world's physics. This limitation along with potential other are not discussed in the paper.\n\nFinally, more than a third (10/26) references point to Arxiv papers. Despite Arxiv definitely being an important tool for paper availability, it is not peer-reviewed and there are also work that are non-finished or erroneous. It is thus a necessary condition that all Arxiv references are replaced by the peer-reviewed material when it exist (e.g. Lerer 2016 in ICML or Denil 2016 in ICLR 2017), once again to strengthen the author's claim.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Acquiring Target Stacking Skills by Goal-Parameterized Deep Reinforcement Learning","abstract":"Understanding physical phenomena is a key component of human intelligence and enables physical interaction with previously unseen environments.
