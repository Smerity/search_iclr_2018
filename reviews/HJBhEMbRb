First let us note that analyzing the generalization performance of gradient methods is an open problem, even in the specific case of 2-layer neural nets and squared-error loss function. Our focus in this work is to address this open problem in the special case of 2-layer NNs with sine activation. We have chosen and analyzed this simple neural network model via Fourier analysis, because as shown in our numerical experiments (section 7) this simple model can still easily overfit random labels. Here is our response to the other questions and comments:\n\n1)  A possible way of extending our Fourier-based analysis to multi hidden layer neural nets is through the analysis of the Fourier representation of composite of sine functions. To apply our Fourier-based analysis of gradient methods for ReLU function, one possible way is to approximate ReLU by its Fourier series after assuming the input X is properly bounded. For a random Y(x), we need to perform our Fourier analysis for the resulting stochastic process instead of a deterministic function. \n\n2)  A sufficient condition for Theorem 4’s bounds is the generalization of the gradients w.r.t. \\alpha. Generalization of the gradients only w.r.t. W does not provide a sufficient condition for applying Theorem 4. Also, establishing generalization w.r.t. both \\alpha and W leads to slower rates of convergence compared to our result in Corollary 3. \n\n3)  For a two layer neural net f(x)=a*phi(Wx) with activation phi, the Lipschitz-based bounds are linear in the square root of W’s norm. Our Corollary 2 improves this dependency to the square root of the log of W’s norm. The improvement holds for bandlimited phi’s such as sine or Gaussian activations.

Here is our response to the three points raised in this review:\n\n1)  The existing Rademacher complexity bounds for neural nets are based on the activation function’s Lipschitz constant.

Our Corollary 2 improves this dependency to the square root of the log of W’s norm. The improvement holds for bandlimited phi’s such as sine or Gaussian activations. \n\n  Although the ReLU function does not satisfy the above condition, our Fourier-based generalization result is still applicable to ReLU-based networks (Theorem 3) and motivates new capacity norms (group path norms) for these networks. \n\n2)  For example, consider a multivariate Gaussian X ~ N( 0 , sigma^2*I). The Fourier transform of P_X in this case, which is  exp{ - (sigma*||w||)^2 / 2 }, becomes sufficiently small in Eq. (39) if the components are O( 1/sigma ) apart. Therefore, we need the standard deviation of X to be large enough so that the components are O( 1/sigma ) apart. We will add this example to section 6.\n\n3)  For an approximate local minimum where the population gradient is epsilon instead of zero, the upper-bound in Lemma 1 (Eq. (12)) changes by at most epsilon and hence the Fourier L1_norm bound in Theorem 4 changes by at most d*epsilon (d is the size of the hidden layer). \n\n  We agree that the isolated components assumption provides a barrier for applying our theory to the general case. However, the condition holds given that Y(x)’s Fourier transform has distant local extrema (at least B(P_X) apart). For example, the condition holds if Y(x)=a^T sin(Wx) where each two different rows w_i,w_j of W satisfy || w_i - w_j || > B(P_X).

It first gives a Fourier-based generalization bound, showing that Rademacher complexity of functions with small bandwidth and Fourier l_1 norm will be small. This leads to generalization for 2-layer networks with appropriate bounded size. For 2-layer networks with sine activation functions, assuming that the data distribution has nice spectral property (ie bounded bandwidth), it shows that the local minimum of the population risk (if with isolated component condition) will have small size, and also shows that the gradient of the empirical risk is close to that of the population risk. Empirical results show that the size of the networks learned on random labels are larger than those learned on true labels, and shows that a regularizer implied by their Fourier-based generalization bound can effectively reduce the generalization gap on random labels. \n\nThe idea of applying the Fourier-based method to generalization is interesting. However, the theoretical results are not very satisfactory. \n-- How do the bounds here compared to those obtained by directly applying Rademacher complexity to the neural network functions? \n-- How to interpret the isolated components condition in Theorem 4? Basically, it means that B(P_X) should be a small constant. What type of distributions of X will be a good example? \n-- It is not easy to put together the conclusions in Section 6.1 and 6.2. Suppose SGD leads to a local minimum of the empirical loss. One can claim that this is an approximate local minimum (ie, small gradient) by Corollary 3. But to apply Theorem 4, one will need a version of Theorem 4 for approximate local minima. Also, one needs to argue that the local minimum obtained by SGD will satisfy the isolated component condition.

Hence it does not contradict Keskar et al.’s results.\n\nHere is the response to the other concerns:\n\n3) We have a typo in this sentence and the word “test” should be replaced with “validation.” To fairly compare different regularization strategies, we tested about 5 lambda values for each strategy and then reported the performance on the test set for the lambda value that resulted in the best performance on the validation set. Good performance here means low generalization gap with comparable validation accuracy for the true labels.\n\n4) Due to computational constraints, we could only test a small set of lambda values for each regularization strategy. For each strategy, we chose the largest lambda coefficient which did not result in more than a 5% decrease in the validation accuracy for true labels. For the X2-group path norm (Figure 1B3), this resulted in test and train accuracies of 0.519 and 0.632 for the true labels and 0.099 and 0.104 for the random labels. For the L2-norm (Figure 1B2), this resulted in test and train accuracies of 0.540 and 0.659 for the true labels and 0.096 and 0.285 for the random labels. Therefore in comparison to the L2 norm, the X2-group path norm achieves smaller generalization gap for both true and random labels (significantly for random labels) without really compromising test accuracy. \n\n5) The point of Figure 2b is to validate our Fourier-based generalization bound, and not to examine path norms which is irrelevant to the plots in Figure 2. Figure 2b demonstrates how the Fourier L1-norm, which is different from path norm, of a neural net with sine activation changes during training. The hypotheses fitting random and true labels have comparable Fourier L1 norm (slightly larger for random labels), but as shown in Figure 2c the bandwidth achieved when fitting random labels is > 1.5 times larger than the bandwidth achieved when fitting true labels. Our generalization result in Theorem 2 depends on both Fourier L1-norm and bandwidth, which correctly predicts that the generalization risk should be larger for random labels.\n\nResponse to the minor points:\n\n1) The Fourier transform of a Gaussian function has a Gaussian shape. Therefore, a Gaussian function’s Fourier transform is concentrated around the origin in a ball with radius inversely proportional to the standard deviation of that Gaussian function and can be arbitrarily well approximated by a bandlimited function. \n\n2,3) This is a technical assumption to obtain the exact value instead of an approximation of a convolution integral. As we have discussed in the Appendix (section 8.6), Theorem 4 (shown through Lemma 1) remains approximately valid even without the isolated components assumption.

They evaluate the generalization bound derived by Bartlett and Mendelson (2002) for bandlimited functions and get  tighter gaurantees than just using lipschitz continuity. They also extend the analysis to the gradients of the loss functions. They also have a few experiments trying to support their claims.\n\nA few concerns -\n\n1) The authors propose using sin function as an activation function over ReLu (or sigmoid). However, they haven't directly compared the accuracy of NNs using ReLu with NNs using sin function. To be more specific, Figure 2 evaluate NNs with sin-activation function using MSE whereas Figure 3 evaluates NNs with ReLu-activation functions using prediction accuracy.\n\n2) In the introduction, Keskar et. al. are cited claiming - 'SGD has been empirically shown to outperform large-batch gradient descent'. However, the Corollary 3 seems to say that the difference between sample-gradient and population-gradient is smaller for large values of samples and hence large-batch gradient descent should outperform SGD. The previous two statements are in direct contradiction.\n\n3) The experimental section states that - \"We note that while we tested multiple values of lambda for each regularization technique, we always chose lambda the that resulted in the smallest generalization gap with comparable test performance.\"\nSuch techniques are classic examples on how to overfit. The standard practice in the community is to choose the lambda via cross-validation.\n\n4) In figure 1b the authors claim that path-norm penalty reduces the generalization error (compared l2 penalty). However, on close observation I see that using path-norm penalty also reduced the accuracy (which is not mentioned in the description). It is well known that reducing the size of the class of functions (to optimize over), reduces both training accuracy and generalization error. Hence it most likely that using path norm is 'effectively' reducing the class of functions and hence decreasing the generalization error (along with accuracy). One could quite possibly acheive the same effect by using l2 norm with a higher value of lambda.\n\n5) From Fig 2b the authors conclude that random labels will have a higher path-norm. However, this is not very convincing to me as it looks like the path-norm for true labels might be equal to the path-norm for the random labels if the experiments were run for a few more epocs.\n\n\nFew minor points\n1) The introduction claims gaussian activation function as bandlimited. Can you explain this?\n2) The assumption in lemma 1 are used only to prove the result and hence seems a little artificial. What is the interpretation of such an assumption?\n3) Lemma 1 requires ||w_j|| to be larger the bandwith of P_X. Large values of W would make the sin function a highly non-monotonous activation function (with high frequency). I don't think such a highly variable non-monotonous functions is a good candidate for an activation functions.\n\n\nConclusion: There is huge disconnect between theretical conclusions and experiments results in this paper.\n1) The theory proposes using sin-activation activation function - However, the sin-activation is not directly compared to ReLu in any experiments.\n2) The theory proposes superiority of path-norm over l2 norm - The experiments are inconclusive (point 5).\n3) The paper claims the gradient methods that accurately estimate the population gradient are expected to have better performance - Keskar et. al.
