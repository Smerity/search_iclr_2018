This is where our explanation lacks. I give more specific explanation.\n“dynamics” means the transition probability of the next state given the current state and action, formally p(s_{t+1} | s_{t}, a_{t}).\nIn a lot of tasks in reinforcement learning, dynamics is usually unknown and difficult to learn.\nIn a sequence generation, however,  s_{t} is the sequence that the generator has generated so far and a_{t} is the next token generation, and s_{t+1} is always [s_{t}, a_{t}], therefore p(s_{t+1} | s_{t}, a_{t}) is deterministic. So, the dynamics is known.\nThis nature is important when we generate fake sequence from expert, like our method. If we do not know the dynamics, we can not determine the next state when we change the certain action.\n\nWe revised the section 2.1 by adding those explanation.\n\nQ,W_e isn't mentioned again, making it unclear what space you're learning in.\nA. W_e is just the embedding matrix (it is learned together with other weights) and we specified the dimension of embedding layer in the description of the experiment section (In synthetic data, the dimension of embedding layer is 32, and in text data, it is 200).\nDoes it answer your question?\n\nQ, The selection of \\alpha.\nA. The selection of \\alpha is important when we use partial reward functions of different scales, because it balances the priorities of the partial correctness of different scale length. Our paper probably should argue it more specifically.\n\nUnfortunately, the selection of  \\alpha_{D_i} is done by nothing but hyper-parameter tuning, and we are aware that it is the problem as we argued in the discussion section. In the text generation task, we prepare two partial reward functions (Long R and Short R), and empirically show the differences of BLEU score and generated sequence when \\alpha is changed. The fact that a true metric for sequence is usually not given (except for the special case, such as oracle test) makes difficult to even validate the goodness of selected \\alpha_{D_i}. This is the reason we only try \\alpha_s = 0.3. and \\alpha_s = 1.0 in the text generation experiment.\n\nI think this problem is not only in our case, but the fundamental problem of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). IRL learns a reward from expert, but the goodness of learned reward function can be evaluated by the behavior of policy, and the evaluation is done by a human (with a bias), or a surrogate manually designed metric.\n\nAbove discussion is included in the discussion (and a little explanation is added in 3.2).\n\nQ, Some concerns about equation 7.\nA. We understand your main concerns.\nIn our paper, equation 7 comes from nowhere, and we do not clearly say that it is completely heuristics. This would confuse readers as you were so.\n\nWe, however, believe that even though the justification of equation 7 is not done in a theoretical way, the justification can also be done in an experimental way. If there is a proper experimental validation for a proposal, the proposal should be the important contribution to the community.\n\nWe revised our paper as below to make section 4 clear.\nWe divided the section 4 into the two subsections 4.1 and 4.2, the one for proposing the idea of expert-based reward function training, and the other one for proposing the modified objective function.\nIn the second subsection, we clearly wrote that\n\n- objective function comes by heuristics and there is no theoretical justification.\n- when \\tau ~= 0, this objective function becomes conventional binary cross entropy.\n- The effectivity of this objective function is validated in the experiment section.\n\nand more specific explanation for the objective as we discussed in the reply for your first review.\n\nPlease have a look at the revised version and give us a reply if you have any other concerns.\n\nBest,"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Toward learning better metrics for sequence generation training with policy gradient","abstract":"Designing a metric manually for unsupervised sequence generation tasks, such as text generation, is essentially difficult.

We are not sure how you understand our paper, so we firstly try to correct your misunderstandings.\n\nThis paper is introducing the two techniques to learn better reward function, partial reward function and expert-based reward function training, rather than introducing new RL approach. From your review, it can be assumed that you think our paper argues about q-learning, but our paper uses policy-based RL approach (it has been firstly done by Ranzato et al. and it is not our novelty) and does not argue about q-learning at all. A policy (or a sequence generator) is learned by a policy gradient, and Q-function is NOT learned by a policy gradient. In REINFORCE, Q-value is estimated by Monte-Carlo samplings. I think the first paragraph of reviewer3 well summarizes our paper. We would appreciate if you could tell us which parts of our paper actually caused your misunderstandings so that we can revise these parts.\n\nQ. Explain about equation 7 specifically.\nA. The motivation of equation 7 is, when the produced fake sequence is not quite different from the true sequence (for example, only one token in the sequence of length 20 is changed), we thought it would be effective to decrease the weight of the objective function, binary cross entropy (BCE), because this fake sequence is actually not so bad sequence. The benefit of decreasing the weight for such sequence is that the learned reward function would become easier to be maximized by a policy gradient, because learned reward function would return some reward to a generated sequence that has some mistakes. In our paper, we describe it as “smooth\" reward function.\nThe parameter \\tau in quality function directly affects the weight of BCE. When \\tau is large, the fake sequence that is little edited from expert one get a large value of quality function, resulting in making (1 - q) / (1 + q) lower than 1, and it decreases the weight of the second term in the right hand side of equation (7). On the other hand, when \\tau is small, the fake sequence that is little edited from expert one gets a near 0 value of quality function, resulting in (1 - q) / (1 + q) ~= 1, and equation (7) becomes the conventional BCE.\nThe term (1 - q) / (1 + q) is heuristic and there is no theoretical background for it, but it enables to control the strictness of the learned reward function by changing the parameter \\tau (“strict” means that only realistic sequence gets the reward close to 1, and others get the reward close to 0. A strict reward function is accurate, but it is considered to be difficult to maximize by a policy gradient because this reward function might be binary-like peaky function). In the experiment, we show that when the partial reward function has long scale, easing the conventional BCE by using \\tau=1.5 is effective.\n\nPlease give us more specific parts that you are still confused, and we are willing to give answers.\n\nBest,"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Toward learning better metrics for sequence generation training with policy gradient","abstract":"Designing a metric manually for unsupervised sequence generation tasks, such as text generation, is essentially difficult.

Specifically, it focuses on addressing the exposure bias problem, where traditional methods such as SeqGAN uses GAN framework and reinforcement learning. Different from these work, this paper does not use GAN framework. Instead, it proposed an expert-based reward function training, which trains the reward function (the discriminator) from data that are generated by randomly modifying parts of the expert trajectories. Furthermore, it also introduces partial reward function that measures the quality of the subsequences of different lengths in the generated data. This is similar to the idea of hierarchical RL, which divide the problem into potential subtasks, which could alleviate the difficulty of reinforcement learning from sparse rewards. The idea of the paper is novel. However, there are a few points to be clarified.\n\nIn Section 3.2 and in (4) and (5), the authors explains how the action value Q_{D_i} is modeled and estimated for the partial reward function D_i of length L_{D_i}. But the authors do not explain how the rewards (or action value functions) of different lengths are aggregated together to update the model using policy gradient. Is it a simple sum of all of them?\n\nIt is not clear why the future subsequences that do not contain y_{t+1} are ignored for estimating the action value function Q in (4) and (5). The authors stated that it is for reducing the computation complexity. But it is not clear why specifically dropping the sequences that do not contain y_{t+1}. Please clarify more on this point.\n","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Toward learning better metrics for sequence generation training with policy gradient","abstract":"Designing a metric manually for unsupervised sequence generation tasks, such as text generation, is essentially difficult.
