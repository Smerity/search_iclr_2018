The library is significantly faster than existing implementations of optimized binary neural networks (≈ 2 orders of magnitude), and will be released on github.\n\nBCNNs have been able to perform well on large-scale datasets with increased speed and decreased  energy consumption, and implementing efficient kernels for them can be very useful for mobile applications.

Isn’t accelerating convolution by this method a very well known one which is implemented in many deep learning frameworks for both CPU and GPU?\n\nWhat is the main contribution that makes the framework here faster than the other compared work?

It also provides optimizations that substantially improve the speed of the forward pass: packing layer bits along the channel dimension, pre-allocation of CUDA resources and binary-optimized CUDA kernels for matrix multiplications. The authors compare their framework to BinaryNET and Nervana/Neon and show a 8x speedup for 8092 matrix-matrix multiplication and a 68x speedup for MLP networks. For CNN, they a speedup of 5x is obtained from the GPU to binary-optimizimed-GPU. A gain in memory size of 32x is also achieved by using binary weight and activation during the forward pass.\n\nThe main contribution of this paper is an optimized code for Binary CNN. The authors provide the code with permissive licensing. As is often the case with such comparisons, it is hard to disentangle from where exactly come the speedups. The authors should provide a table with actual numbers instead of the hard-to-read bar graphs. Otherwise the paper is well written and relatively clear, although the flow is somewhat unwieldy. \n\nOverall, i think it makes a good contribution to a field that is gaining importance for mobile and embedded applications of deep convnets. I think it is a good fit for a poster.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Espresso: Efficient Forward Propagation for Binary Deep Neural Networks","abstract":"  There are many applications scenarios for which the computational\n  performance and memory footprint of the prediction phase of Deep\n  Neural Networks (DNNs) need to be optimized.
