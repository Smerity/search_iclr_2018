Because of this, early training benefits from the simultaneous update, as all options are implicated in every action. As training progresses, the t-SNE experiments demonstrate that is little overlap between final policies. Each policy appears to be active in a different region of state space. This is likely due to the fact that the most likely option is most updated, rather than a single option being updated improperly in the event of an unlikely action.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"An inference-based policy gradient method for learning options","abstract":"In the pursuit of increasingly intelligent learning systems, abstraction plays a vital role in enabling sophisticated decisions to be made in complex environments.

As shown in the line before Eqn. 3, the conditional assumption that we make is slightly different. It is true that a_k and r_j are not independent in general. However, they are conditionally independent given s_k and s_j, and a_j. We are conditioning on all of the observed states and observed actions since the start of the trajectory.

Here, we focus on the issue that all three reviewers raised: that A3C does as well as IOPG in most environments.\n\nIt is our opinion that A3C ought to perform roughly as well as IOPG. The optimization performed is nearly identical between the two algorithms, where IOPG is parameterized in a particular manner such that options can be learned. We developed IOPG as a data-efficient method to optimize several options simultaneously. We present it in a general form, without any sort of regularization on the structure of the options. Even without such regularization, the options learned by IOPG express some worthwhile characteristics, which several existing option learning algorithms cannot produce: namely temporal extension, and spatial separation. Without additional problem-specific regularization on the structure of those options, there is no reason to expect performance improvements in the single-task setting.\n\nThis said, we feel that the extra structure learned by IOPG yields several benefits. Options can be useful for the interpretation of agent behaviours, as our t-SNE experiments (Fig. 3) show. Further there is strong evidence to suggest that learned options can be useful for transfer learning (OptionGAN: Henderson et al. 2018, Option-Critic: Bacon et al. 2017, Subgoal Discovery: McGovern and Barto 2001). We feel that these benefits make IOPG a worthwhile algorithm, especially since it comes at no cost to data efficiency, variance, or asymptotic learning compared to A3C.

The assumption is that rewards from the past are not correlated with actions in the future conditioned on the state s_t (otherwise we would always have a correlation) ,which  is needed to use the policy gradient theorem. The assumption is only true for MDPs. However, using the option index as latent variable yields a PoMDP. There, this assumption does not hold any more. Example: Reward at time step t-1 depends on the action, which again depends on the option o_t-1. Action at time step t depends on o_t. Hence, there is a strong correlation between reward r_t-1 and action a_t+1 as o_t and o_t+1 are strongly correlated. o_t is not a conditional variable of the policy as it is not part of the state, thats why this assumption does not work any more.\n\nSummary: The paper is well written and presents a good extension of inference based option discovery.

The options framework provides formalism for such abstraction over sequences of decisions.  However most models require that options be given a priori, presumably specified by hand, which is neither efficient, nor scalable. Indeed, it is preferable to learn options directly from interaction with the environment. Despite several efforts, this remains a difficult problem: many approaches require access to a model of the environmental dynamics, and inferred options are often not interpretable, which limits our ability to explain the system behavior for verification or debugging purposes.  In this work we develop a novel policy gradient method for the automatic learning of policies with options.  This algorithm uses inference methods to simultaneously improve all of the options available to an agent, and thus can be employed in an off-policy manner, without observing option labels. Experimental results show that the options learned can be interpreted. Further, we find that the method presented here is more sample efficient than existing methods, leading to faster and more stable learning of policies with options.","pdf":"/pdf/760c3354a1ccdad4ba240b1e7e3be36fdc545981.pdf","TL;DR":"We develop a novel policy gradient method for the automatic learning of policies with options using a differentiable inference step.","paperhash":"anonymous|an_inferencebased_policy_gradient_method_for_learning_options","_bibtex":"@article{\n  anonymous2018an,\n  title={An inference-based policy gradient method for learning options},\n  author={Anonymous},\n  journal={International Conference on Learning Representations},\n  year={2018},\n  url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJIgf7bAZ}\n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1136/Authors"],"keywords":["reinforcement learning","hierarchy","options","inference"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":8,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"}],"limit":2000,"offset":0}
