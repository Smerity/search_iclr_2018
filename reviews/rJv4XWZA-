The dimensionality of data would not be an issue either, because noise is added in an embedding space (and not in the original feature space) for each dimension independently, making the method agnostic to the dimensionality of original data. As reported in the paper, we have done experiments with the SVHN dataset, which has 3072-dimensional input vectors.\nMoving on to your second question. Thank you for drawing our attention to this paper. We were not aware of it and missed it when studying the related work.\nWhile the main ideas are indeed similar, there is a major difference in our method: the way of preserving privacy in GAN training. On the initial stages of our work, we explored the possibility of using differentially private SGD, but we found that achieving reasonable privacy bounds requires adding too much noise to gradients and makes GAN training much harder than it already is. The aforementioned paper confirms our findings by showing that the noise quickly overpowers the gradient (Fig. 1(e)) and that using the GAN after the final epoch is not sufficient for obtaining realistic data (Fig. 2(a)). Instead, we propose adding noise in the forward pass, which improves convergence properties and generated data quality.\nThis difference leads to a number of advantages. Most importantly, our technique does not require additional procedures for picking specific generator epochs or modifying optimisation methods. Moreover, it can be implemented by simply adding a noise layer to the discriminator, and we formally show that this is sufficient for achieving differential privacy."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Generating Differentially Private Datasets Using GANs","abstract":"In this paper, we present a technique for generating artificial datasets that retain statistical properties of the real data while providing differential privacy guarantees with respect to this data.

Moreover, even for this high privacy loss the accuracy on the SVHN dataset seems to drop a lot (92% down to 83%) when proposed mechanism is used.\n-- I didn't find a formal proof of the privacy guarantee in the paper.

However, my main concern is the privacy aspect of the technique, as it is not explained clearly enough in the paper. There is also room for improvement in the presentation and clarity of the paper.\n\nMore details:\n- About the differential privacy aspect:\n  The author didn't provide detailed privacy analysis of the Gaussian noise layer, and I don't find the values of the sensitivity (C = 1) provided in the answer to a public comment easy to see. Also, the paper mentioned that the batch size is 32 and the author mentioned in the comment that the std of the Gaussian noise is 0.7, and the number of epoch is 50 or 150. I think these values would lead to epsilon much larger than 8 (as in Table 1). However, in Section 5.2, it is said that \"Privacy bounds were evaluated using the moments accountant and the privacy amplification theorem (Abadi et al., 2016), and therefore, are data-dependent and are tighter than using normal composition theorems.\" I don't see clearly why privacy amplification is needed here, and why using moments accountant and privacy amplification can lead to data-dependent privacy loss.\n  In general, I don't find the privacy analysis of this paper clear and detailed enough to convince me about the correctness of the privacy results. However, I am very happy to change my opinion if there are convincing details in the rebuttal.\n\n- About the presentation:\n  As a paper proposing a differentially private algorithm, detailed and formal analysis of the privacy guarantees is essential to convince the readers. For example, I think it would be much better if there is a formal theorem showing the sensitivity of the Gaussian noise layer. And it would be better to restate (in Appendix 7.4) not only the definition of moments accountant, but the composition and tail bound, as well as the moments accountant for the Gaussian mechanism, since they are all used in the privacy analysis of this paper.\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Generating Differentially Private Datasets Using GANs","abstract":"In this paper, we present a technique for generating artificial datasets that retain statistical properties of the real data while providing differential privacy guarantees with respect to this data.

Non-interactive mechanisms have been one of the most sought-after approaches in differentially private algorithm design. The reason is that once a differentially private data set is released, it can be used in any way to answer queries / perform learning tasks without worrying about the privacy budget. However, designing effective non-interactive mechanisms are notoriously hard because of strong computational lower bounds. In that respect, the problem addressed in this paper is extremely important, and the approach of using an adversarial network for the task is very natural (yet novel).\n\nThe main idea in the paper is to set up a usual adversarial framework with the generator and the discriminator, where the discriminator has access to the raw data. The information (in the form of gradients) is passed from the discriminator on to the generator via a differentially private channel (using Gaussian mechanism).\n\nPositive aspects of the paper: One main positive aspect of the paper is that it comes up with a very simple yet effective approach for a non-interactive mechanism for differential privacy. Another positive aspect of the paper is that it is very well-written and is easy to follow.\n\nQuestions: I have a few questions about the paper.\n\n1. The technical novelty of the paper is not that high. Given the main idea of using a GAN, the algorithms and the experiments are fairly straightforward. I may be missing something. I believe the paper can be strengthened by placing more emphasis on the technical content.\n\n2. I am mildly concerned about the effectiveness of the algorithm in the high dimensional setting. The norm of i.i.d. Gaussian noise scales roughly as \\sqrt{dimensions}, which may be too much to tolerate in most settings.\n\n3. I was wondering if there is a way to incorporate assumptions about sparsity in the original data set, to handle curse of dimensionality.\n\n4. I am not sure about the novelty of Theorem 2.
