The bold w is the vector having N elements and w_i is the data quality level of an i-th weather station. We have fixed the confusions in the updated draft. \n\n7) >>\n- In our paper, we assume that if two connected nodes (weather stations) are located in similar spatial features, these nodes highly likely observe similar meteorological measurements. Thus, if two connected nodes provide very different observations, we think that these observations are not reliable and could be noisy. Furthermore, if there is a group of connected nodes and some nodes observe significantly different measurements with other nodes in the group, we can say that the measurements are too heterogeneous and not reliable. In other words, the data quality level is associated with noisy as well as heterogeneous observations.\n- For the anomaly detection, what we would like to propose is that the embeddings from our model can be used to visualize nodes based on their connectivity and observations. For example, in Figure 3, the red dot (v_22) is connected with the green dots (v_19, v_20, v_21, v_23, v_25, v_29). Since these nodes have similar spatial features and are connected, it is expected to have similar observations. At t=0, the distribution of the nodes seems like a cluster. However, v_25 is far away from other green nodes and the red node at t=4. There are two possible reasons. First, observations of v_25 at t=4 may be too different with those of other green nodes and the red node. Second, observations of a node (v_4) that is only connected to v_25 (not other green nodes and the red node) might be too noisy. In the first case, since it violates our assumption (v_25's observations should be similar with those of another green node.), the observations of v_25 at t=4 might be noisy or not reliable. In the second case, the observations of v_4 at t=4 might be noisy. Thus, we can detect potentially anomalous nodes by looking at the distribution of nodes. (A bridge node is not necessary to be an anomaly.)\n- The anomaly comes from temporal observations by comparing to neighbor observations. Thus, two aspects (spatial and temporal) are jointly considered. \n\n8) >> \nThanks for your pointing out. We agree that the sentence you quote can cause some confusion. A bridge node in our paper is considered as a node connecting two (or more) clusters that consist of nodes having similar features. As a result, a bridge node is affected by two (or more) different groups of nodes simultaneously, and thus, the quality level at the bridge node is more susceptible than those of other nodes. However, it doesn’t directly mean that it is necessary for a bridge node to have a lower data quality level.\n\n9) >>\nThanks for your suggestion and we update the conference information in the revised version. \n\nQuality, Clarity, Originality, Significance >>\nWe do not agree with the comment on significance. Our paper proposes a novel solution to automatically infer data quality levels based on local variations of graph signals and demonstrate that the quality levels can be used to reduce forecasting error and detect potentially anomalous observations. It provides a new idea on inferring interpretable quantity without explicit labels. We agree that there is limited work in ICLR  on data quality, but it is definitely one essential hurdle for any representation learning model to work in practice.

We would like to stress that assessing and mitigating heterogeneity of data quality is an extremely important but less-studied topic in machine learning. Our work aims at positioning the task and providing one possible solution to address this important problem. The novelty of the paper lies in this important contribution rather than purely the novelty of the proposed model.\n\nBelow is our response to the questions. \n1) and 3) >>\nThanks for pointing out this potentially confusing issues. To build a symmetric adjacency matrix, we did not set a fixed number of neighbors. Instead, we defined the neighbors by the Gaussian kernel weights with the weight threshold. Since the numbers of the weather stations in WeatherBug(WB) and Weather Underground(WU) are different (#WU:42, #WB:159), the average numbers of neighbors in the datasets are too different under the same bandwidth(\\gamma). We aim at evaluating our model under similar degree distribution (similar topology) and therefore, we adjust the bandwidth to make the average numbers of adjacent neighbors in two dataset be similar under the 0.9 threshold. The average degrees are 6.0 and 7.5 for WU and WB, respectively.\n\n2) >>\n- Each weather station in the data sources (WU and WB) has a different temporal resolution. Some weather stations have observed measurements in every 5 minutes but other weather stations have operated sensors in every 30 minutes. So, we fix the temporal granularity as 1 hour and aggregate observations in each hour by averaging them. \n- N is the total number of weather stations and #WU:42, #WB:159. \n- T is the total length of signals and it is 744(hours) (24(hours/day)*31(day)) for July and August.\n\n4) >>\nThis is a very good point. Yes, we are aware that features represented in a large number (e.g., latitude ~ 34 degree) can dominate features represented in a small number (e.g., vegetation fraction < 1.0) , which is exactly what we want to avoid. Thus, it is a must to normalize the features before using them for computing the distances. As you point out, equal weighting may be not perfectly correct, however, this is what we can do without any domain knowledge.\n\n5) >>\n- It is a very good point too. Interestingly, the Los Angeles area contains many microclimates, which means that the daytime temperatures can vary as much as 36°F (19°C) between inland areas such as the San Fernando Valley and the coastal Los Angeles Basin. The temperature differences between different areas are more obvious during the summer season (than other seasons). For example, the average high temperature (°F) can vary as much as 26°F for July and August on 9 different regions (Downtown LA, LAX, Santa Monica, Culver City, Long Beach, San Fernando Valley, Burbank, Santa Ana, and Anaheim). In contrast, it varies only 6°F for December and January in the same regions. Thus, it is more challenging to predict temperatures in the summer season, which is why we choose two months (7 and 8) that often shows extreme fluctuations of temperatures.\n- The bigger picture of our work is investigating urban heat island effect in Los Angeles areas. Temperature is the most important factor in urban heat island and exhibits more variations (and more difficult to predict). In contrast,  other observations, such as Relative Humidity or Precipitation, are very stable in Los Angeles areas. They are very easy to predict and therefore cannot justify for a complex model.\n\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Automatically Inferring Data Quality for Spatiotemporal Forecasting","abstract":"The importance of learning from spatiotemporal data has been growing with increasing amounts of data sources distributed over space.

Although we haven’t compared our method to these random-walk-based methods, the multi-layer GCNs with the data quality networks are more flexible to learn latent interactions between temporal observations due to their nonlinearity and compositional property.

Paper reads better and comparison to Auto-regression was added. This work presents a novel way of utilizing GCN and I believe it would be interesting to the community. In this regard, I have updated my rating.\n\nOn the downside, I still remain uncertain about the practical impact of this work. Results in Table 1 show that proposed method is capable of forecasting next hour temperature with about 0.45C mean absolute error. As no reference to any state of the art temperature forecasting method is given (i.e. what is the MAE of a weather app on a modern smartphone), I can not judge whether 0.45C is good or bad. Additionally, it would be interesting to see how well proposed method can deal with next day temperature forecasting.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nIn this paper authors develop a notion of data quality as the function of local variation of the graph nodes. The concept of local variation only utilizes the signals of the neighboring vertices and GCN is used to take into account broader neighborhoods of the nodes. Data quality then used to weight the loss terms for training of the LSTM network to forecast temperatures at weather stations.\n\nI liked the idea of using local variations of the graph signals as quality of the signal. It was new to me, but I am not very familiar with some of the related literature. I have one methodological and few experimental questions.\n\nMethodology:\nWhy did you decide to use GCN to capture the higher order neighborhoods? GCN does so intuitively, but it is not clear what exactly is happening due to non-linearities. What if you use graph polynomial filter instead [1] (i.e. linear combination of powers of the adjacency)? It can more evidently capture the K-hop neighborhood of a vertex.\n\nExperiments:\n- Could you please formalize the forecasting problem more rigorously. It is not easy to follow what information is used for training and testing. I'm not quite certain what \"Temperature is used as a target measurement, i.e., output of LSTM, and others including Temperature are used as input signals.\" means. I would expect that forecasting of temperature tomorrow is solely performed based on today's and past information about temperature and other measurements.\n- What are the measurement units in Table 1?\n- I would like to see comparison to some classical time series forecasting techniques, e.g. Gaussian Process regression and Auto-regressive models. Also some references and comparisons are needed to state-of-the-art weather forecasting techniques. These comparisons are crucial to see if the method is indeed practical.\n\nPlease consider proofreading the draft. There are occasional typos and excessively long wordings.\n\n[1] Aliaksei Sandryhaila and José MF Moura. Discrete signal processing on graphs.

The authors introduce a new definition of data quality that relies on the notion of local variation defined in (Zhou and Schölkopf, 2004), and they extend it to multiple heterogenous data sources. The data quality function is learned using a GCN as defined in (Kipf and Welling, 2016).\n \n1) How many neighbors are used in the experiments? Is this fixed or is defined purely by the Gaussian kernel weights as mentioned in 4.2? Setting all weights less than 0.9 to zero seems quite abrupt. Could you provide a reason for this? How many neighbors fit in this range?\n2) How many data points? What is the temporal resolution of your data (every day/hour/minute/etc.)? What is the value of N, T? \n3) The bandwidth of the Gaussian kernel (\\gamma) is quite different (0.2 and 0.6) for the two datasets from Weather Underground (WU) and Weather Bug (WB) (sect. 4.2). The kernel is computed on the features (e.g., latitude, longitude, vegetation fraction, etc.). Location, longitude, distance from coast, etc. are the same no matter the data source (WU or WB). Maybe the way they compute other features (e.g., vegetation fraction) vary slightly, but I would guess the \\gamma should be (roughly) the same. \n4) Are the features (e.g., latitude, longitude, vegetation fraction, etc.) normalized in the kernel? If they are given equal weight (which is in itself questionable) they should be normalized, otherwise some of them will always dominate the distances. If they were indeed normalized, that should be made clear in the paper.\n5) Why do you choose the summer months? How does the framework perform on other months and other meteorological signals except temperature? The application is very nice and complex, but I find that the experiments are a little bit too limited. \n6) The notations w and W are used for different things, and that is slightly confusing. Usually one is used as a matrix notation of the other.\n7) I would tend to associate data quality with how noisy observations are at a certain node, and not heterogeneity. It would be good to add some discussion on noise in the paper. How do you define an anomaly in 5.2? Is it a spatial or temporal anomaly? Not sure I understand the difference between an anomaly and a bridge node. \n8) “A bridge node highly likely has a lower data quality level due to the heterogeneity”. I would think a bridge node is very relevant, and I don't necessarily see it as having a lower data quality. This approach seems to give more weight to very similar data, while discarding the transitions, which in a meteorological setting, could be the most relevant ?! \n9) Update the references, some papers have updated information (e.g., Bruna et al. - ICLR 2014, Kipf and Welling – ICLR 2017, etc.).\n\nQuality – The experiments need more work and editing as mentioned in the comments.  \nClarity – The framework is fairly clearly presented, however the English needs significant improvement. \nOriginality – The paper is a nice application of machine learning and neural nets to data quality assessment, and the forecasting application is relevant and challenging. However the paper mostly provides a framework that relies on existing work.\nSignificance – While the paper could be relevant to data quality applications by introducing advanced machine learning techniques, it has limited reach outside the field. Maybe publish it in a data quality conference/journal.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":2,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Automatically Inferring Data Quality for Spatiotemporal Forecasting","abstract":"The importance of learning from spatiotemporal data has been growing with increasing amounts of data sources distributed over space.
