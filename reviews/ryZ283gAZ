Our responses to the reviewer's comments are as follows. We have made minor modifications to the manuscript to improve clarity (especially Section 3). \n\nReviewer: Is it possible to show stability of the architecture of deep networks based on their associated ODEs?\n\nOur Responses: One of the cited references discussed stability [Bo Chang, Lili Meng, Eldad Haber, Lars Ruthotto, David Begert, and Elliot Holtham. Reversible architectures for arbitrarily deep residual neural networks. arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.03698, 2017]. The authors disceretized a stable ODE to construct a neural network. However, BN or other stochastic training may break the stability. In our opinion, the relavance of stability (of numerical schemes or the ODE itself) to deep architecture design is still a debatable topic. It definitely deserves further invesigation, which will be our future work.\n\nReviewer: It is very interesting to consider networks as stochastic dynamic systems. Are there any limitations of this interpretation or discrepancy due to the weak approximation?\n\nOur Responses: It is a very interesting question. In the revised version of the manuscript, we included some discussions related to this question. In short, under suitable conditions on the parameters, we will have a weak limit. However, at this point, we are not sure whether all the conditions are indeed satisfied in practice. Nonetheless, the weak limit may shed light on the choice of the hyper-parameters, such as the drop probabilities of the stochastic depth ResNet (see our discussions on stochastic depth in Section 3.1)."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Beyond Finite Layer Neural Networks: Bridging Deep Architectures and Numerical Differential Equations","abstract":"Deep neural networks have become the state-of-the-art models in numerous machine learning tasks.

Our responses to the reviewer's comments are as follows. We have made minor modifications to the manuscript to improve clarity (especially Section 3). \n\nReviewer: It is not clear why the proposed approach is superior to the other designs\n\nOur Responses: We have already discuss this in the paper. Most of recent work like SENet, PolyNet, Inception-v4, are focusing on the improvment of the residual block, which means improving the right-hand-side of the dynamics f(u). We explore the other\ndimension, i.e. the ways to design shortcuts by bridging some of the existing designs of shortcuts with various temporal discretization of dynamic systems. Then we introduced a new micro-structure, called the LM-structure, which can be combined with exsiting designs of f(u). For example, you could have LM-PolyNet, LM-Inception, etc. We take ResNet and ResNeXt as examples to show that the LM-structure can indeed improve accuracy and compress parameters over the original deep networks. We also showed that the LM-structure can also be combined with stochastic training strategy in Section 3.\n\nReviewer: Gains are relatively small and at a price of a more complicated design\n\nOur Responses: The design is SIMPLE! You only need to include one more shortcut to each block of ResNet (or other similar networks). We will comment on \"gains are relatively small\" in our later responses.\n\nReviewer: Incosistent baselines reported\n\nOur Responses: This is because lots of the setting is not the same, like the data augmentation setting is not the same as the [Table5 Xie et al, 2017 (aka ResNeXt)] on Imagenet. We don't apply color jitter, lighting and color normalization. Thus we don't think using the baseline in the ResNeXt paper is a fair comparsion. Moreover, the ResNeXt paper did not use the pre-act ResNet. Nonetheless, we will do more experiment to make the experiment stronger.\n\nReviewer: Experimentwise, the authors show some gains on CIFAR 10/100, or 0.5% (see ResNeXt Table1), while\nalso introducing slightly more parameters.\n\nOur Responses: For ResNeXt is not a deep network, the acceleration of the LM-structure will not bring as much benefits as deeper networks.  If we use the LM-structure in deep neural networks, the accuracy will boost significantly. LM-Resnet56 achieves comparable accuracy as LM-Resnet 110 (see ResNet Table 1) on CIFAR10. And LM-ResNet164 gains 1.4% accuracy over ResNet164 on CIFAR100, which is only 0.2% lower than the accuracy of ResNet1001.  On the other hand, the reviewer commented that our LM-ResNeXt \"only\" gains 0.5% accuracy boost by adding 0.7M parameters. Let's take a look at the result of ResNeXt again, ResNeXt29(16x64d) adding 34M paramters to ResNeXt29(8x64d), only gains 0.46%. Therefore, we do not think 0.5% is a small improvement for ResNeXt."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Beyond Finite Layer Neural Networks: Bridging Deep Architectures and Numerical Differential Equations","abstract":"Deep neural networks have become the state-of-the-art models in numerous machine learning tasks.

Our responses to the reviewer's comments are as follows. We have made minor modifications to the manuscript to improve clarity (especially Section 3). \n\nReviewer:  The paper does not define the meaning of u_n=f(u)\n\nOur Response: There should be a subscript \"n\" of the variable \"u\". We apologize for the confusion. It is a standard notation for a discrete dynamic system. \n\nReviewer: The stochastic control problem (what is the role of controller, how is connected to the training\nprocedure) is not defined\n\nOur Response: The reviewer may have missed our definition of stochastic control, which is given at the end of Section 3.1. The optimization problem is a stochastic control if we consider, for example, the ResNet with stochastic training as a stochastic dynamic system (stochastic ResNet for short). The \"control\" is the stochastic differential equation weakly approximated by the stochastic ResNet. For there is an expectation in the objective function, we only need a week approximation, which means we only need to approximate the distribution of data instead of each individual data (or trajectory). Stochastic control is a classical and yet important topic in applied mathematics, which has wide applications in various areas especially finance. We recommend a popular tutorial given by L. Evans \"Evans L C. OPTIMAL CONTROL THEORY. Springer, 1974\" for further reference.\n\nReviewer: While the experiments are done in CIFAR-10 and 100, ImageNet and improvements are reported,\nhowever, connection/insights to why the improvement is obtained is still missing. Thus the evidence is\nonly partial, i.e., we still don't know why the connection between ODE and ResNet is helpful at all. \n\nOur Response: The reviewer may have missed our explanation on the performance boost of the proposed LM-structure. We explained the performance boost using the concept of \"modified equations\" from the bottom of page 6 to page 8. Basically, we argued, both analytically and experimentally, that the proposed LM-structure can be viewed as adding a momentum to the information propagation.\n\nReviewer: Agreed that LM methods are better approximations of the ODEs. Where do we gain? (a) It helps if we faithfully discretize the ODE. Why does (a) help? We don't have a clear answer; which takes back to the lack of what the underlying stochastic control problem is.\n\nOur Responses: As we stated a couple times in the manuscript, our purpose is not to show that we should seriously approximate dynamic systems. Our main objective is to point out that effective architectures (or topology of the networks) are similar (or identical for some cases) to discretizations of dynamic systems. This is not limited to ResNet. It is more general than what have been discovered in the past. More importantly, we are able to introduce the LM-structure, which is new and can be applied to any ResNet-like networks to significantly compress the number of parameters. If your application does not care about parameter compression, LM-structure can still further improve classification accuracy of heavy-duty networks. Finally, if stochastic training is applied, we identify it with the stochastic control problem, and it is still beneficial to apply the LM-structure to discretize the underlying stochastic differential equation. The performance boost shown by our experiments can be explained using modified equations, which to our best knowledge, is a new perspective to qualitatively evaluate deep networks that can be viewed as approximations of dynamic systems.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Beyond Finite Layer Neural Networks: Bridging Deep Architectures and Numerical Differential Equations","abstract":"Deep neural networks have become the state-of-the-art models in numerous machine learning tasks.

However, general guidance to network architecture design is still missing. In our work, we bridge deep neural network design with numerical differential equations. We show that many effective networks, such as ResNet, PolyNet, FractalNet and RevNet, can be interpreted as different numerical discretizations of differential equations. This finding brings us a brand new perspective on the design of effective deep architectures. We can take advantage of the rich knowledge in numerical analysis to guide us in designing new and potentially more effective deep networks. As an example, we propose a linear multi-step architecture (LM-architecture) which is inspired by the linear multi-step method solving ordinary differential equations. The LM-architecture is an effective structure that can be used on any ResNet-like networks. In particular, we demonstrate that LM-ResNet and LM-ResNeXt (i.e. the networks obtained by applying the LM-architecture on ResNet and ResNeXt respectively) can achieve noticeably higher accuracy than ResNet and ResNeXt on both CIFAR and ImageNet with comparable numbers of trainable parameters. In particular, on both CIFAR and ImageNet, LM-ResNet/LM-ResNeXt can significantly compress (>50%) the original networks while maintaining a similar performance. This can be explained mathematically using the concept of modified equation from numerical analysis. Last but not least, we also establish a connection between stochastic control and noise injection in the training process which helps to improve generalization of the networks. Furthermore, by relating stochastic training strategy with stochastic dynamic system, we can easily apply stochastic training to the networks with the LM-architecture. As an example, we introduced stochastic depth to LM-ResNet and achieve significant improvement over the original LM-ResNet on CIFAR10.","pdf":"/pdf/e757d4b34fd712fdae365e67c8ae6e841dd1761b.pdf","TL;DR":"This paper bridges deep network architectures with numerical (stochastic) differential equations.
