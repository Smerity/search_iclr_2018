Both robustness and stability bound the affect of local perturbations. The key difference, IMO, is that robustness deals with perturbations of the test example, whereas stability deals with perturbations of a single training example. Robustness also constrains the test example perturbations to be within a certain partition of the instance space, whereas stability allows the perturbations to range over the entire instance space.\n\nFor algorithms that are both robust and stable, which analysis yields better bounds? Since the paper is concerned with deep learning, consider the stability results in Hardt et al. (2016) or Kuzborskij & Lampert (2017) for learning with non-convex objectives. If one were to combine these results with Elisseeff et al.'s generalization bounds, would the resulting bounds be better or worse than the ones in this paper?

We have revised the paper to explain the data partitioning principles better and address here the main points the reviewer raises. \n\nRegarding partition for sets: \nGenerally, there is a trade-off between epsilon(s) and, K, the larger K is the smaller \\epsilon(s) due to the finer tiling as the reviewer suggested. This tradeoff is also evident in the bound of Theorem 1, where the right-hand side increases with K and \\epsilon(s) so there is a minimum point (see Corollaries 4&5 in Xu&Mannor 2012 for choosing the minimal K).  \n \nHowever, in the context of Deep Neural Networks, we chose k=n (training data size), to be an implicit partition such that each set contains a small R2 ball around each training example, without specifying the partition explicitly. We then approximate the loss in this partition using the adversarial example, i.e., approximating the maximal loss in the partition using the adversarial example. While this approximation is loose, we show that empirically, it is correlated with generalization. Under this partition, there is no violation of the IID assumption for general stochastic algorithms, but it is violated in the case of adversarial training as the reviewer suggested. However, simulations suggest that correlation exists for both.\n\n\nRegarding weak robustness: We are more interested in the standard generalizability and found weak robustness to be out of the scope of this work. We do believe however that similar bound can be derived for weak robustness of randomized algorithms using the same techniques we used in this work.

Moreover, we have shown that taking an expectation over robustness indeed improves the correlation between robustness and generalization, which we later demonstrate how to evaluate efficiently through Bayesian networks.

Both robustness and generalization are important properties of learning algorithms. It is good to see that the authors made some efforts towards this direction.\n2, The paper is well shaped and is easy to follow. The analysis conducted in this paper is sound. Numerical experiments are also convincing. \n3, The extended notion \"ensemble robustness\" is shown to be very useful in studying the generalization properties of several deep learning algorithms. \n\nCons:    \n\n1,  The terminology \"ensemble\" seems odd to me, and seems not to be informative enough.\n2,  Given that the stability is considered as a weak notion of robustness, and the fact that the stability of a learning algorithm and its relations to the generalization property have been well studied, in my view, it is quite necessary to mention the relation of the present study with stability arguments. \n3, After Definition 3, the author stated that ensemble robustness is a weak notion of robustness proposed in Xu and Manner, 2012. It is better to present an example here immediately to illustrate.

Stability and robustness are two examples of desired properties of a learning algorithm that can also guarantee generalization under some conditions.\n\nA stable algorithm produces an output hypothesis that is stable to small changes in the data set, i.e., if a training example is replaced with another example from the same distribution, the training error will not change much. Elisseeff et al. (JMLR, 2005), indeed showed that algorithm that fulfills this requirement generalize well. \n\nRobustness, on the other hand, is a different property of learning algorithms. A Robust algorithm produces a hypothesis that is robust to bounded perturbations of the entire data set, as we explain in more detail in our paper. Robustness and Stability are different properties, to see that observe that robustness is a global property while stability is local, and that robustness concerns properties of a single hypothesis, while stability concerns two (one for the original data set and one for the modified one).  \n\nWe emphasize that a learning algorithm may be both stable and robust, e.g., SVM, \"Robustness and Regularization of Support Vector Machines,\" Huan Xu, Constantine Caramanis, Shie Mannor 2009).

The contribution of the authors would be stronger if they can discuss an equivalent notion in their context.\n\nThe partition considered by the framework is never discussed nor taken into account, while this is an important aspect of the analysis. In particular, there is a tradeoff between \\epsilon(s) and K:  using a very fine tiling it is always possible to have a very small \\epsilon(s) at the price of a very large K (if you think of a covering number, K can be exponential in the size of the tiling and hard to calculate). \nIn the context of adversarial examples, this is actually important because it can be very likely that the adversarial example can belong to a partition set different from the set the original example belong to. \nIn this context, I am not sure to understand the validity of the framework because we can then compare 2 instances of different set which is outside of the framework. \nSo I wonder if the way the adervarial examples are generates should be taken into account for the definition of the partition.\nAdditionnally, the result is given in the contect of IID data, and with a multinomial distribution according to the partition set - adversarial generation can violate this IID assumption.\n\nIn the experimental setup, the partition set is not explained and we have no guarantee to compare instances of the same set. Nothing is said about $r$ and its impact on the results. This is a clear weak aspect of the experimental analysis\nIn the experimental setup, as far as I understand the setup, I find the term \"generalization error\" a bit abusive since it is actually the error on the test set. \nUsing cross validation or considering multiple training/test sets would be more appropriate.\n\n\nIn the proof of Lemma 2, I am not sure to understand where the term 1/n comes from in the term 2M^2/2 (before \"We then bound the term H as follows\")\n\n","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Ensemble Robustness and Generalization of Stochastic Deep Learning Algorithms","abstract":"The question why deep learning algorithms generalize so well has attracted increasing\nresearch interest.
