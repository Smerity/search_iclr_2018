We include many comparisons with the classification image method used by Vondrick et al. (2015) that focus on the mental content of the captured distributions, which is the goal of our paper (see Figures 2, 3, and 5, as well as Table 1). Like Vondrick et al. (2015), we show that classifiers derived from mental distributions do better than chance in predicting labels of real images. However, unlike Vondrick et al. (2015), note that we are not interested in augmenting computer vision methods to improve benchmark scores, but rather in developing innovative methods for modeling human mental representations.\n\nAnswers to specific comments and questions:\n\n- Our newest draft makes Figure 1 more informative. Note that the inference network does not need to be used, and was not used in Section 4.1, because we know which z vectors generated which images for each set of trials, and do not need to convert the generated images back to inferred z representations in practice. However, the inference network is necessary for any application of our method that requires the use of any image not rendered by the network (i.e., in order to classify new images such as in Section 4.3).\n\n- Figure 2 has been enlarged and the newest uploaded draft extends the caption. The FLD projections simply show that the chains for different categories are well-separated, meaning that they successfully characterize different featural content.\n\n- We told AMT workers that it was important that they answer as best they can and used stringent selection criteria. If a single image did not load, the data was thrown out and a new subject was recruited to continue the chain at its original entry point. \n\n- In order to include inference in our GAN network, we use BiGAN (Donahue et al., 2016).\n\n- In Figure 4, we show the means of the mixture components with the largest mixture weights. We excluded only a small set of components that were presumably useful in explaining holdout samples and classifying, but which had no discernable visual content (washed out brown color). This appears to happen whenever large numbers of samples are summarized by a single mean (the CI method often showed only this behavior).\n\n- Comparing MCMCP Density and MCMCP Mean for groups 1 and 2 tells us little because the individual categories do not always give the same results. More importantly, we see the variation in results as a lesson that an inflexible method may not be able to cope with particular categories and how they interact with the particular latent space learned by the network. Using MCMCP avoids having to make any such limiting assumptions, and we can simply choose the density with the best fit to human samples."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Capturing Human Category Representations by Sampling in Deep Feature Spaces","abstract":"Understanding how people represent categories is a core problem in cognitive science, with the flexibility of human learning remaining a gold standard to which modern artificial intelligence and machine learning aspire.

We agree that more can be done to inspect the nature of the solution obtained by combining MCMCP with modern generative networks, but we see this as future application of the overall toolset we’ve designed and demonstrated in the current work. The suggested method of using classification features to change image attributes assumes a linear/additive feature space. Since we can learn any distribution with MCMCP, these simple methods do not apply to the general case.\n\nOne of the methods we used to compare Classification Images (CI) and MCMCP was to assess how learned mental distributions could predict class labels for images held out from the training set. However, it is important to note that any held out set of images suffers from the same dataset bias that we sought to avoid (see introduction). For this reason, while a better estimate of a mental concept may perform better than other methods in predicting held out sets, there is no guarantee that it will converge to a model that performs equally or better than classifiers trained on those biased datasets. In keeping with the specific goals of our paper, we included no such analysis in our paper. However, the reviewer may find it useful to know that classifiers trained on a similar training set to the held out images were more successful in predicting class labels for those held out images (the test set). Inspecting the samples from the captured mental distributions gives us good reason to believe mental and synthetic concepts are different because many images favored by humans appear a great deal more abstract than what would be expected from current generative models (e.g., see water bottle examples).\n\nIt is unclear how stratification of classes in the datasets used to train our networks detract significantly from the results presented in our paper (i.e., it is unlikely to interact with our finding regarding the improvement over CI). Also note that we strategically avoided classes that are most disproportionately represented in the ILSVRC12 dataset, such as “dog”, which makes up more than 10% of the dataset."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Capturing Human Category Representations by Sampling in Deep Feature Spaces","abstract":"Understanding how people represent categories is a core problem in cognitive science, with the flexibility of human learning remaining a gold standard to which modern artificial intelligence and machine learning aspire.

On these insights, the paper felt\nincomplete.\n\nFor example, it was not investigated whether the method identifies\nclassification features that generalize.  The faces experiment is\nsimilar to previous work done by Martin (2011) and Kontsevich\n(2004) but unlike that previous work does not investgiate whether\nclassification features have been identified that can be added to an\narbitrary image to change the attribute \"happy vs sad\" or \"male vs female\".\n\nSimilarly, the second experiment in Table 1 compares classification\naccuracy between different sampling methods, but it does not provide\nany comparison as done in Vondrick (2015) to a classifier trained\nin a conventional way (such as an SVM), so it is difficult to discern\nwhether the learned distributions are informative.\n\nFinally, the effect of choosing GAN features vs a more \"naive\" feature\nspace is not explored in detail.
