At this point, the novelty is weaken.\n\nBesides providing a probabilistic justification for autoencoders, we also propose DAuto as a new model to handle domain adaptation.

Perhaps we could phrase it as \"One of the limitations of mSDA is that it needs to explicitly form the covariance matrix of input features and then solves a linear system, which can be computationally expensive to solve exactly in high dimensional settings, but approximate scheme exists.\"\n\nWhat we would like to emphasize is the fact that mSDA is more like a two-stage algorithm, where feature learning and discriminative training are separated. On the other hand, DAuto is more end-to-end, which combines feature learning, discriminative training and domain adaptation in a unified model. In time-series modeling the latter might be more favorable because it has the power to adapt to the change in distribution along time.

We attempt to clarify several points below.\n\nQ: The only criticism that I have towards this analysis is that the concept of shared parameter between the discriminative and predictive model (denoted by zeta in the paper) disappear when it comes to designing the learning model.  \n\nzeta does not disappear in DAuto, and in fact DAuto is precisely designed to follow the probabilistic principle discussed in Section 3.1 to 3.3. In Fig. 2, the zeta corresponds to the shared component f: f and g together instantiate p(x), while f and h together instantiate p(y|x). In other words, phi = parameters in f union parameters in g, and psi = parameters in f union parameters in h. So zeta = phi intersects psi = parameters in f.\n\n\nQ: Also, a comparison with the Generative Adversarial Networks of Goodfellow et al. (2014) would be a plus.\n\nThis is indeed a great question, and we'd like to clarify here. Although DAuto is designed to consider the marginal distribution over x, and we use kernel density estimation to construct this density explicitly, DAuto does not have efficient sampling schemes to actually generate samples from the distribution. On the other hand, from GAN we cannot compute the density of a given instance explicitly, but it allows us to draw samples from it in a straightforward way. \n\n\nQ: I would also like to see the results obtained using DANN stacked on mSDA representations, as it is done in Ganin et al. (2016).\n\nStacking with mSDA representations can indeed boost the performances of all the models, including DANN, Ladder and DAuto uniformly on the Amazon dataset. On average we see around 2 percent improvements in classification accuracy on Amazon.\n\n\nThanks again for all the detailed comments as well!

We attempt to answer the questions below. \n\nQ:  The paper will be more interesting if the authors are able to extend the discussion on different forms of prior instead of the simple parameter sharing scheme. \n\nAs we show in section 3.1, one necessary condition under the probabilistic framework is that phi and psi cannot be independent, otherwise the maximization of marginal distribution over x would be independent of the discriminative task, hence phi and psi need to be correlated. While there are many ways that phi and psi could be correlated, one sufficient and frequently used assumption in practice is that they share some common parameters, under which we show that this corresponds to minimizing reconstruction loss using autoencoders. Other possible choices include phi being a function of psi, etc., but such choice has not been frequently used in practice, so we focus on the parameter sharing scheme in this work. \n\n\nQ:  The minimax loss employed in DANN and DAuto is known to be prone to degenerated gradient for the generator. It would be interesting to see if the additional auto-encoder part help address the issue. \n\nYes, that's right. As we observed empirically in our experiments the reconstruction loss from autoencoders do indeed tend to stablize the joint optimization, but theoretically we don't know how to formally prove this yet. \n\n\nQ:  The experiments miss some of the more recent baseline in domain adaptation, such as Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation (Tzeng, Eric, et al. 2017). \n\nThanks for pointing out this work! We've incorporated a comparison to ADDA as well, please check the revised submission. As a high-level summary, given that all the methods use exactly the same network structures and training protocols, ADDA does perform very well on several adaptation tasks, while DAuto excels on other tasks. This shows that using asymmetric encoders and using reconstruction loss as regularization can both contribute to adaptation, perhaps in an orthogonal way. \n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Principled Hybrids of Generative and Discriminative Domain Adaptation","abstract":"We propose a probabilistic framework for domain adaptation that blends both generative and discriminative modeling in a principled way.

This provides a way to interpret the empirical success of autoencoders in domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning. We instantiate our framework using neural networks, and build a concrete model,  \\emph{DAuto}. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DAuto on text, image and speech datasets, showing that it outperforms related competitors when domain adaptation is possible.\n","pdf":"/pdf/e557edd1fa3e2a9b24aa6dc1b4069763ef957073.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|principled_hybrids_of_generative_and_discriminative_domain_adaptation","_bibtex":"@article{\n  anonymous2018principled,\n  title={Principled Hybrids of Generative and Discriminative Domain Adaptation},\n  author={Anonymous},\n  journal={International Conference on Learning Representations},\n  year={2018},\n  url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1NGT8xCZ}\n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper278/Authors"],"keywords":["domain adaptation","neural networks","generative models","discriminative models"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":8,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"}],"limit":2000,"offset":0}
