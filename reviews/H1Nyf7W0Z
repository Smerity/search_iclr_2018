My main concerns about this work are have two aspects: \n(a)\tNovelty\n1.\tThe idea is a good one and is great incremental research building on the top of previous ideas. I do not agree with statements like “We demonstrate that the proposed objective function generalizes ML and RL objective functions …” that authors have made in the abstract. There is not enough evidence in the paper to validate this statement.\n(b)\tExperimental Results\n2.\tThe performance of the proposed method is not significantly better than other models in MT task. I am also wondering why authors have not tried their method on at least one more task? E.g., in CNN+LSTM based image captioning, the perplexity is minimized as cost function but the performance is measured by BLEU etc.  \n\nSome minor comments: \n\n1.\tIn page 2, 6th line after eq (1), “… these two problems” --> “… these three problems” \n2.\tIn page 2, the line before the last line, “… resolbing problem” --> “… resolving problem”\n","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Alpha-divergence bridges maximum likelihood and reinforcement learning in neural sequence generation","abstract":"Neural sequence generation is commonly approached by using maximum- likelihood (ML) estimation or reinforcement learning (RL).

It is argued that the ML approach has some \"discrepancy\" between the optimization objective and the learning objective, and the RL approach suffers from bad sample complexity. An alpha-divergence formulation is considered to combine both methods.\n\nUnfortunately, I do not understand main points made in this paper and am thus not able to give an accurate evaluation of the technical content of this paper. I therefore have no option but to vote for reject of this paper, based on my educated guess. \n\nBelow are the points that I'm particularly confused about:\n\n1. For the ML formulation, the paper made several particularly confusing remarks. Some of them are blatantly wrong to me. For example, \n\n1.1 The q(.|.) distribution in Eq. (1) *cannot* really be the true distribution, because the true distribution is unknown and therefore cannot be used to construct estimators. From the context, I guess the authors mean \"empirical training distribution\"?\n\n1.2 I understand that the ML objective is different from what the users really care about (e.g., blue score), but this does not seem a \"discrepancy\" to me. The ML estimator simply finds a parameter that is the most consistent to the observed sequences; and if it fails to perform well in some other evaluation criterion such as blue score, it simply means the model is inadequate to describe the data given, or the model class is so large that the give number of samples is insufficient, and as a result one should change his/her modeling to make it more apt to describe the data at hand. In summary, I'm not convinced that the fact that ML optimizes a different objective than the blue score is a problem with the ML estimator.\n\nIn addition, I don't see at all why this discrepancy is a discrepancy between training and testing data. As long as both of them are identically distributed, then no discrepancy exists.\n\n1.3 In point (ii) under the maximum likelihood section, I don't understand it at all and I think both sentences are wrong. First, the model is *not* trained on the true distribution which is unknown. The model is trained on an empirical distribution whose points are sampled from the true distribution. I also don't understand why it is evaluated using p_theta; if I understand correctly, the model is evaluated on a held-out test data, which is also generated from the underlying true distribution.\n\n2. For the RL approach, I think it is very unclear as a formulation of an estimator. For example, in Eq. (2), what is r and what is y*? It is mentioned that r is a \"reward\" function, but I don't know what it means and the authors should perhaps explain further. I just don't see how one obtains an estimated parameter theta from the formulation in Eq. (2), using training examples.","confidence":"1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Alpha-divergence bridges maximum likelihood and reinforcement learning in neural sequence generation","abstract":"Neural sequence generation is commonly approached by using maximum- likelihood (ML) estimation or reinforcement learning (RL).

The objective is based on alpha-divergence between the true input-output distribution q and the model distribution p. The new objective generalizes  Reward-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (RAML) and entropy-regularized Reinforcement Learning (RL), to which it presumably degenerates when alpha goes to 1 or to 0 respectively.\n\nThe paper has significant writing issues. In Paragraph “Maximum Likelihood”, page 2, the formalization of the studied problem is unclear. Do X and Y denote the complete input/output spaces, or do they stand for the training set examples only?  In the former case, the statement “x is uniformly sampled from X” does not make sense because X is practically infinite. Same applies to the dirac distribution q(y|x), the true conditional distribution of outputs given inputs is multimodal even for machine translation. If X and Y were meant to refer to the training set, it would be worth mentioning the existence of the test set. Furthermore, in the same Section 2 the paper fails to mention that reinforcement learning training also does not completely correspond to the evaluation approach, at which stage greedy search or beam search is used.\n\nThe proposed method is evaluated on just one dataset. Crucially, there is no comparison to a trivial linear combination of ML and RL, which in one way or another was used in almost all prior work, including GNMT, Bahdanau et al, Ranzato et al. The paper does not argue why alpha divergence is better that the aforementioned combination method and also does not include it in the comparison.\n\nTo sum up, I can not recommend the paper to acceptance, because (a) an important baseline is missing (b) there are serious writing issues.\n","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Alpha-divergence bridges maximum likelihood and reinforcement learning in neural sequence generation","abstract":"Neural sequence generation is commonly approached by using maximum- likelihood (ML) estimation or reinforcement learning (RL).
