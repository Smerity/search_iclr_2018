When the agents are forced to use the linguistic channel exclusively, they must learn from scratch how to use the linguistic channel to communicate effectively to solve the negotiation task and thus the proposal channel is never communicated to the opponent. In short, LINGUISTIC refers to negotiating using ONLY the linguistic channel, PROPOSAL only the preference and BOTH using the combination.\n\n>By the very nature of the employed learning mechanisms, the provided solution provides little insight into what the emerging communication is really about. \n\nIt is difficult to quantify precisely what communication is about, especially in our bottom-up approach starting from arbitrary symbols. Despite this, in our post-processing analyses of the communication analyses, we show: (i) agents partition themselves into speaker and listener, (ii) elements of natural language are found in the protocols that emerged, and (iii) the content of the messages indicate that the agents are encoding their utilities in the language channel. \n\n>In my view, the lack of interpretable semantics hardly warrants a reference to 'cheap talk'. As such the expectations set by the well-developed introduction and background sections are moderated over the course of the paper.\n\nWe did not intend to suggest that the lack of interpretable semantics warrants a reference to cheap talk. We refer to cheap talk due to the fact that the exchanges in the linguistic channel have no effect on the resulting payoff, which follows directly from the definition.\nThe lack of interpretable semantics is orthogonal to any references to cheap talk: it simply motivates the research question of whether communication can emerge among learning agents.

Given that the agents’ rewards would be improved if they were able to make agreements, and humans can use ‘cheap talk’ to negotiate, surely the inability to do so here shows a failure of the learning algorithm (rather than a general property of self-interested agents)?\n\nWe agree; we believe this is the the main reason that the bottom-up approach is particularly challenging. Humans (and to a lesser extent, the demonstration data in top-down approaches) benefit by having a priori semantics on the symbols in the linguistic channel. We used the term ‘self-interested agents’ mainly to separate them from the prosocial ones, but we do indeed mean in the context of the standard RL learning algorithms used in the paper, not more generally to mean ‘any possible self-interested agent’. We will clarify this.\nIn future work, we will explore more sophisticated RL learning techniques that allow self-interested to negotiate using a ‘cheap-talk’ channel (which due to its unbinding and unverifiable nature poses a challenge for the current RL algorithms).\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Emergent Communication through Negotiation","abstract":"Multi-agent reinforcement learning offers a way to study how communication could emerge in communities of agents needing to solve specific problems.

Do they correspond to arbitrary labels or the turns that the agent takes in the game?\n\nWe have clarified that Agent 1 is the agent who consistently goes first in negotiation.\n\n>Why is Agent 1 the one who triumphs in the no-communication channel game? Is there any advantage to going first generally?\n\nActually, Agent 2 typically triumphs in the no-communication setup. We do not believe there is any significant advantages to either going first or second, as demonstrated by the fact that self-interested agents seem to be able to negotiate fairly in this environment.\n\n>Where are the tests of robustness on the curves demonstrated in Figure 2a?\n\nWe have re-run the experiments with 20 different random seeds, and have updated Figure 2a to show their averaged results. The uncertainty estimates are unfortunately only visible in the linguistic communication setup, as the other communication protocols seem to give rise to very stable training.\n\n>Has figure 2b been cherry picked? This should be demonstrated over many different negotiations with error bars.\n\nFigure 2b shows the average reward per turn over 1000 different negotiations. We present results from training 20 seeds (1280 test negotiations per seed). We have added interquartile ranges at every timestep, and clarified that they are averaged results in the text.\n\n>Protocols could be designed that would allow the agents to communicate their utilities over this channel (within 4 turns), so the fact they don't suggests it is the learning procedure that is not able to find this optimum.\n\nWe agree. However, discovering the optimal protocol through self-play RL is a significantly harder problem than designing one with knowledge of the optimal structure. For example, the pre-grounded nature of the proposal channel, combined with its lower information bandwidth, means that random exploration is less likely to find the optimal communication protocol.\n\n>Why are the 10 turn games even included in this table? It seems that this was dismissed in the environment setup section, due to the first mover advantage.\n\nWe include the 10 turn results so that we can include the key self-interested and prosocial results in the same table. We also wanted to demonstrate how strong the first mover advantage was. We have moved these results to the appendix however in the new draft.\nWe have also changed both tables to return mean and interquartile range as suggested.\n\n>Why do self-interested agents for 10 turns on the linguistic channel terminate early?\nWe believe that when enough information is exchanged, the agents make effective proposals and thus do not need to negotiate further.\n\n>Both Figure 4 and Table 3 use Agent 1 and Agent 2 rather than Agent A and Agent B and is not clear whether this is a mistake or Agent 1 is different from Agent A.\n\nWe have corrected this.\n\n>The no-communication baseline is referred to in the text but the results are not shown in the table.\n\nWe have added the no-communication baseline figure to the text.\n\n>There are no estimates of the uncertainty of the results in table 3, how robust are these results to different initial conditions?\n\nThese results are averaged across 10 batches of 128 games in each batch.

","rating":"5: Marginally below acceptance threshold","review":"The experimental setup is clear, although the length of the utterances and the number of symbols in them is not explicitly stated in the text (only the diagrams).\n\nExperiment 1 confirms that agents who seek only to maximise their own rewards fail to coordinate over a non-binding communication channel. The exposition of the experiments, however, is unclear.\nIn Fig 1, it is not clear what Agent 1 and Agent 2 are. Do they correspond to arbitrary labels or the turns that the agent takes in the game?\nWhy is Agent 1 the one who triumphs in the no-communication channel game? Is there any advantage to going first generally? Where are the tests of robustness on the curves demonstrated in Figure 2a?\nHas figure 2b been cherry picked? This should be demonstrated over many different negotiations with error bars.\nIn the discussion of the agents being unable to ground cheap talk, the symbolic nature of the linguistic channel clouds the fact that it is not the symbolic, ungrounded aspect but the non-binding nature of communication on this channel. This would be more clearly demonstrated and parsimonious by using a non-binding version of the proposal channel and saving the linguistic discussion for later.\n\nExperiment 2 shows that by making the agents prosocial, they are able to learn to communicate on the linguistic channel to achieve pretty much optimal rewards, a very nice result.\nThe agents are not able to reach the same levels of cooperation on the proposal channel, in fact performing worse than the no-communication baseline. Protocols could be designed that would allow the agents to communicate their utilities over this channel (within 4 turns), so the fact they don't suggests it is the learning procedure that is not able to find this optimum. Presenting this as a result about the superiority of communication over the linguistic channel is not well supported.\nWhy do they do worse with random termination than 10 turns in the proposal channel? 4 proposals should contain enough information to determine the utilities.\nWhy are the 10 turn games even included in this table? It seems that this was dismissed in the environment setup section, due to the first mover advantage.\nWhy do no-communication baselines change so much between random termination and 10 turns in the prosocial case?\nWhy do self-interested agents for 10 turns on the linguistic channel terminate early?\nTable 1 might be better represented using the median and quartiles, since the data is skewed.\n\nAnalysis of the communication, i.e. what is actually sent, is interesting and the division into speaker and listener suggests that this is a simple protocol that is easy for agents to learn.\n\nExperiment 3 aims to determine whether an agent is able to negotiate against a community of other agents with mixed levels of prosociality. It is shown that if the fixed agent is able to identify who they are playing against they can do better than not knowing, in the case where the fixed agent is self interested.\nThe pca plot of agent id embeddings related is good.\nBoth Figure 4 and Table 3 use Agent 1 and Agent 2 rather than Agent A and Agent B and is not clear whether this is a mistake or Agent 1 is different from Agent A.\nThe no-communication baseline is referred to in the text but the results are not shown in the table.\nThere are no estimates of the uncertainty of the results in table 3, how robust are these results to different initial conditions?\nThis section seems like a bit of an add-on to address criticisms that might arise about the initial experiment being only two agents.\n\nOverall, the paper has some nice results and an interesting ideas but could do with some tightening up of the results to make it really good.\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Emergent Communication through Negotiation","abstract":"Multi-agent reinforcement learning offers a way to study how communication could emerge in communities of agents needing to solve specific problems.

The central feature is the consideration of a secondary communication (linguistic) channel for the purpose of cheap talk, i.e. talk whose semantics are not laid out a priori. \n\nThe essential findings include that prosociality is a prerequisite for effective communication (i.e. formation of meaningful communication on the linguistic channel), and furthermore, that the secondary channel helps improve the negotiation outcomes.\n\nThe paper is well-structured and incrementally introduces the added features and includes staged evaluations for the individual additions, starting with the differentiation of agent characteristics, explored with combination of linguistic and proposal channel. Finally, agent societies are represented by injecting individuals' ID into the input representation.\n\nThe positive:\n- The authors attack the challenging task of given agents a means to develop communication patterns without apriori knowledge.\n- The paper presents the problem in a well-structured manner and sufficient clarity to retrace the essential contribution (minor points for improvement).\n- The quality of the text is very high and error-free.\n- The background and results are well-contextualised with relevant related work. \n\nThe problematic:\n- By the very nature of the employed learning mechanisms, the provided solution provides little insight into what the emerging communication is really about. In my view, the lack of interpretable semantics hardly warrants a reference to 'cheap talk'. As such the expectations set by the well-developed introduction and background sections are moderated over the course of the paper.\n- The goal of providing agents with richer communicative ability without providing prior grounding is challenging, since agents need to learn about communication partners at runtime. But it appears as of the main contribution of the paper can be reduced to the decomposition of the learnable feature space into two communication channels. The implicit relationship of linguistic channel on proposal channel input based on the time information (Page 4, top) provides agents with extended inputs, thus enabling a more nuanced learning based on the relationship of proposal and linguistic channel. As such the well-defined semantics of the proposal channel effectively act as the grounding for the linguistic channel. This, then, could have been equally achieved by providing agents with a richer input structure mediated by a single channel. From this perspective, the solution offers limited surprises. The improvement of accuracy in the context of agent societies based on provided ID follows the same pattern of extending the input features.\n- One of the motivating factors of using cheap talk is the exploitation of lying on the part of the agents. However, apart from this initial statement, this feature is not explicitly picked up. In combination with the previous point, the necessity/value of the additional communication channel is unclear.\n\nConcrete suggestions for improvement:\n\n- Providing exemplified communication traces would help the reader appreciate the complexity of the problem addressed by the paper.\n- Figure 3 is really hard to read/interpret. The same applies to Figure 4 (although less critical in this case).\n- Input parameters could have been made explicit in order to facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of technicalities (e.g. in appendix).\n- Emergent communication is effectively unidirectional, with one agent as listener. Have you observed other outcomes in your evaluation?\n\nIn summary, the paper presents an interesting approach to combine unsupervised learning with multiple communication channels to improve learning of preferences in a well-established negotiation game. The problem is addressed systematically and well-presented, but can leave the reader with the impression that the secondary channel, apart from decomposing the model, does not provide conceptual benefit over introducing a richer feature space that can be exploited by the learning mechanisms. Combined with the lack of specific cheap talk features, the use of actual cheap talk is rather abstract. Those aspects warrant justification.","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Emergent Communication through Negotiation","abstract":"Multi-agent reinforcement learning offers a way to study how communication could emerge in communities of agents needing to solve specific problems.

Some questions on this:\n  - you report the standard deviation across samples in a single batch of 128 games. To what extent did the fraction of reward vary across entire training runs?\n  - you state that for prosocial, proposal channel only, the reward fraction was 0.92. However, in my own training run, the reward plateau's at ~0.81, after ~50,000 episodes of 128 games, and stays at ~0.81 for the remaining ~800,000 episodes, https://github.com/ASAPPinc/emergent_comms_negotiation/raw/master/images/20171104_144936_proposal_social_nocomms_b.png?raw=true  Thoughts?

For example, the paper states 'self-interested agents cannot ground cheap talk. When using the linguistic channel, agents do not negotiate optimally. Instead, the agents randomly alternate taking all the items, which is borne out by the oscillations in Figure 2a.' I wonder whether it might be useful to have similar curves for the prosocial agents, so we can easily see how the behavior of prosocial and not prosocial agents compares?\n- why have length 6 for the comms channel? Presumably it mostly just needs to be able to represent the hidden utility, which is sufficient for the other agent to have complete world state information?
