Unfortunately, the paper in its current form is a bit thin on content.\n \nMain issues:\nNo related works (such as those using RNN for time series analysis or clustering of time series data streams etc.) were described by the paper, no baselines were used in the comparison evaluations, and no settings/details were provided in the experiment section. As a result, it is quite difficult to judge the merits and novelty of the paper.\n \nOther issues:\nsome contribution claims highlighted in the Discussion Section, i.e., Section 4, are arguable and should be further extended. For example, the authors claim that the proposed LSTM-based autoencoder networks can be natively scaled up to data with very high dimensionality. I would like the authors to explain it in more details or empirically demonstrate that, since a LSTM-based model could be computationally expensive. As another example, the authors claim that reducing the dimensionality of the output sequence is one of the main contributions of the paper. In this sense, further elaborations from that perspective would be very beneficial since some networks already employ such a mechanism. \n\nIn short, the paper in its current form does not provide sufficient details for the reviewer to judge its merits and contributions.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Recurrent Auto-Encoder Model for Multidimensional Time Series Representation","abstract":"Recurrent auto-encoder model can summarise sequential data through an encoder structure into a fixed-length vector and then reconstruct into its original sequential form through the decoder structure.

The authors show that for their application, better performance is obtained when the network is only trained to reconstruct a subset of the data measurements. The paper also presents some visualizations the similarity structure of the learned representations and proposes a window-based method for processing the data.\n\nAccording to the paper, the experiments are done using a data set which is obtained from measurements of an industrial production process. Figure 2 indicates that reconstructing fewer dimensions of this dataset leads to lower MSE scores. I don’t see how this is showing anything besides the obvious fact that reconstructing fewer dimensions is an easier task than reconstructing all of them.  The only conclusions I can draw from the visual analysis is that the context vectors are more similar to each other when they are obtained from time steps in the data stream which are close to each other. Since the paper doesn’t describe much about the privately owned data at all, there is no possibility to replicate the work. The paper doesn’t frame the work in prior research at all and the six papers it cites are only referred to in the context of describing the architecture.\n\nI found it very hard to distil what the main contribution of this work was according to the paper. There were also not many details about the precise architecture used. It is implied that GRU networks and were used but the text doesn’t actually state this explicitly. By saying so little about the data that was used, it was also not clear what the temporal correlations of the context vectors are supposed to tell us. \n\nThe paper describes how existing methods are applied to a specific data set. The benefit of only reconstructing a subset of the input dimensions seems very data specific to me and I find it hard to consider this a novel idea by itself. Presenting sequential data in a windowed format is a standard procedure and not a new idea either. All in all I don't think that the paper presents any new ideas or interesting results.\n\nPros:\n* The visualizations look nice.\n\nCons:\n* It is not clear what the main contribution is.\n* Very little information about the data. \n* No clear experiments from which conclusions can be drawn.\n* No new ideas.\n* Not well rooted in prior work.\n","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Recurrent Auto-Encoder Model for Multidimensional Time Series Representation","abstract":"Recurrent auto-encoder model can summarise sequential data through an encoder structure into a fixed-length vector and then reconstruct into its original sequential form through the decoder structure.
