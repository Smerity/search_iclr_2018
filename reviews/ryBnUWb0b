What is clear is that the neural network models do outperform the other models. We've changed some of the wording to highlight this point and not make it a strictly LSTM vs others approach but instead a neural network vs others approach. Although given more complicated examples, we think the LSTM would perform better on the IO task. However, generating more data is very time-consuming so it makes the overall problem difficult to model.\n\nBut we believe the point you mentioned with hierarchical LSTMs is extremely relevant in this context because it allows a foundation on which to build future work to model the full problem end-to-end with a model based on LSTM architectures and the hierarchical approaches mentioned. We added this point in the future direction and certainly think it's feasible but it'll likely require more data and model design. \n\n However, we're still fine-tuning the LSTM to see why there was a 1% drop."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Predicting Floor-Level for 911 Calls with Neural Networks and Smartphone Sensor Data","abstract":"In cities with tall buildings, emergency responders need an accurate floor level location to find 911 callers quickly.

We're working on adding your suggestions and will post an update in the next few weeks.\n\nWanted to let you know we've improved the results from 91% to 100% by adjusting our regularization mechanism in the LSTM. We'll make the appropriate changes to the paper.\n\n\"The paper could use some reorganization\"\n1. Agreed and the updated draft will have:\n    - Cleaner organization\n    - Upfront clarification about the GPS signal\n    - Shortened discussion about the neural net model\n\n\"The RNN model for Indoor/Outdoor determination is compared to several baseline classifiers.\"\n2. The problem is reduced to classification by creating a fixed window of width k (in our case, k=3) where the middle point is what we're trying to classify as indoors/outdoors. \n    - Happy to add the HMM comparison.\n    - Happy to add a time series comparison.\n\n\"p.2,  Which channel's RSSI is the one included in the data sample per second?\n\"\n3. We get the RSSI strength as proxied by the iPhone status bar. Unfortunately, the API to access the details of that signal is private. Therefore, we don't have that detailed information. However, happy to add clarification about how exactly we're getting that signal (also available in the sensory app code).\n\n\n4. k is the window size. Will clarify this.  \n\n\"Do you assume that the entrance is always at the lowest floor? What about basements or higher floor entrances? \"\n\n5. We actually don't assume the entrance is on the lower floors. In fact, one of the buildings that we test in has entrances 4 stories appart. This is where the clustering method shines. As soon as the user enters the building through one of those lower entrances, the floor-level indexes will update because it will detect another cluster.\n\n\n\"Also, you may continue to see good GPS signals in elevators that are mounted outside a building, and by the time they fade out,  you can be on any floor reached by those elevators.\"\n6. Yup, this is true. Unfortunately this method does heavily rely on the indoor/outdoor classifier. \n    - We'll add a brief discussion to highlight this issue.\n\n\n\"How does each choice of your training parameters affect the performance?  e.g. number of epoches, batch size, learning rate.   What are the other architectures considered?  What did you learn about which architecture works and which does not?  Why?\n\"\n7. We can add a more thorough description about this and provide training logs in the code that give visibility into the parameters for each experiment and the results.\n    - The window choice (k) actually might be the most critical hyperparameter (next to learning rate). The general pattern is that a longer window did not help much. \n    - The fully connected network actually does surprisingly well but the RNN generalizes slightly better. A 1-layer RNN did not provide much modeling power. It was the multi-layer model that added the needed complexity to capture these relationships. We also tried bi-directional but it failed to perform well. \n\n\"As soon as you start to use clustering to help in floor estimation, you are exploiting prior knowledge about previous visits to the building.  This goes somewhat against the starting assumption and claim.\n\"\n8. Fair point. We provide a prior for each situation will will get you pretty close to the correct floor-level. However, it's impossible to get more accurate without building plans, beacons or some sort of learning. We consider the clustering method more of the learning approach: It updates the estimated floor heights as either the same user or other users walk in that building. In the case where the implementer of the system (ie. A company), only wants to use a single-user's information and keep it 100% on their device, the clustering system will still work using that user's repeated visits. In the case where a central database might aggregate this data, the clusters for each building will develop a lot faster and converge on the true distribution of floor heights in a buillding."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Predicting Floor-Level for 911 Calls with Neural Networks and Smartphone Sensor Data","abstract":"In cities with tall buildings, emergency responders need an accurate floor level location to find 911 callers quickly.

I want to preface the breakdown below by letting you know that we added time-distributed dropout which helped our model's accuracy. The new accuracy is 100% with no margin of error in the floor number.\n\n1. As of June 2017 the market share of phones in the US is 44.9% Apple and 29.1% Samsung [1]. 74% are iPhone 6 or newer [2]. The iPhone 6 has a barometer [3].

Makes sense, we separated it for the non deep learning audience trying to understand it. However, happy to update everything to say LSTM.\n3. Thanks for this great suggestion. We had experimented with end-to-end models but decided against it.  We did have a seq2seq model that attempted to turn the sequence of readings into a sequence of meter offsets. It did not fully work, but we're still experimenting with it. This model does not however get rid of the clustering step.  \n\nAn additional benefit of separating this step from the rest of the model is that it can be used as a stand-alone indoor/outdoor classifier. \n\nI'll address your concerns one at a time:\n    a. In which task would it perform better? The indoor-outdoor classification task or the floor prediction task?\n    c. What about this model would solve the issue of the user being on the roof?\n    d. Just to make sure I understand, the one-hot encoding suggestion aims to learn a mapping between the floor height and the barometric pressure which in turn removes the need for clustering?\n    e. This sounds like an interesting approach, but seems to fall outside of the constraint of having a self-contained model which did not need prior knowledge. Generating a one-hot encoding for every building in the world without a central repository of building plans makes this intractable.\n\n4. We used the bias (tensorflow LSTM cell). https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/rnn/LSTMCell\n5. Happy to add explanations for why the \"ad-hoc\" parameters were chosen:\n    a. Jaccard window, binary mask lengths, and window length were chosen via grid search.\n    b. Will add those details to the paper.\n\n6. Yes! All the data + code will be made public after reviews. However, if you feel strongly about having it before, we can make it available sooner through an anonymous repository. In addition, we're planning on releasing a basic iOS app which you'll be able to download from the app store to run the model on your phone and see how it works on any arbitrary building for you.\n\n7. Yes, many typos. Apologize for that. We did a last minute typo review too close to the deadline and missed those issues. This is in fact going to change now that we've increased the model accuracy to 100% with no floor margin of error.\n\nWe're updating the paper now and will submit a revised version in the coming weeks"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Predicting Floor-Level for 911 Calls with Neural Networks and Smartphone Sensor Data","abstract":"In cities with tall buildings, emergency responders need an accurate floor level location to find 911 callers quickly.

However I still feel like the novelty is somewhat limited, hence the recommendation.\n\n======================\n\nThe paper introduces a system to estimate a floor-level via their mobile device's sensor data using an LSTM to determine when a smartphone enters or exits a building, then using the change in barometric pressure from the entrance of the building to indoor location. Overall the methodology is a fairly simple application of existing methods to a problem, and  there remain some methodological issues (see below).\n\nGeneral Comments\n- The claim that the bmp280 device is in most smartphones today doesn’t seem to be backed up by the “comScore” reference (a simple ranking of manufacturers).  Please provide the original source for this information.\n- Almost all exciting results based on RNNs are achieved with LSTMs, so calling an RNN with LSTM hidden units a new name IOLSTM seems rather strange - this is simply an LSTM.\n- There exist models for modelling multiple levels of abstraction, such as the contextual LSTM of [1]. This would be much more satisfying that the two level approach taken here, would likely perform better, would replace the need for the clustering method, and would solve issues such as the user being on the roof.  The only caveat is that it may require an encoding of the building (through a one-hot encoding) to ensure that the relationship between the floor height and barometric pressure is learnt. For unseen buildings a background class could be used, the estimators as used before, or aggregation of the other buildings by turning the whole vector on.\n- It’s not clear if a bias of 1 was added to the forget gate of the LSTM or not. This has been shown to improve results [2].\n- Overall the whole pipeline feels very ad-hoc, with many hand-tuned parameters.  Notwithstanding the network architecture, here I’m referring to the window for the barometric pressure, the Jaccard distance threshold, the binary mask lengths, and the time window for selecting p0.\n- Are there plans to release the data and/or the code for the experiments? Currently the results would be impossible to reproduce.\n- The typo of accuracy given by the authors is somewhat worrying, given that the result is repeated several times in the paper.\n\nTypographical Issues\n- Page 1:  ”floor-level accuracy” back ticks\n- Page  4:   Figure  4.1→Figure  1;  Nawarathne  et  al  Nawarathne  et  al.→Nawarathne et al.\n- Page 6:  ”carpet to carpet” back ticks\n- Table 2:  What does -4+ mean?\n- References.

Using the entrance point's barometer reading as a reference, the method calculates the relative floor the user has moved to using a well known relationship between heights and barometric readings.\n\nThe paper builds on a simple but useful idea and is able to develop it into a basic method for the goal.  The method has minimal dependence on prior knowledge and is thus expected to have wide applicability, and is found to be sufficiently successful on data collected from a real world context.  The authors present some additional explorations on the cases when the method may run into complications.\n\nThe paper could use some reorganization.   The ideas are presented often out of order and are repeated in cycles, with some critical details that are needed to understand the method revealed only in the later cycles.   Most importantly, it should be stated upfront that the outdoor-indoor transition is determined using the loss of GPS signals.  Instead, the paper elaborates much on the neural net model but delays until the middle of p.4 to state this critical fact.

We introduce a system to estimate a victim's floor level via their mobile device's sensor data in a two-step process. First, we train a neural network to determine when a smartphone enters or exits a building via GPS signal changes. Second, we use a barometer equipped smartphone to measure the change in barometric pressure from the entrance of the building to the victim's indoor location. Unlike impractical previous approaches, our system is the first that does not require the use of beacons, prior knowledge of the building infrastructure, or knowledge of user behavior. We demonstrate real-world feasibility through 63 experiments across five different tall buildings throughout New York City where our system predicted the correct floor level with 100% accuracy.\n","pdf":"/pdf/487fa214323a4924a224167789572e7e28160da0.pdf","TL;DR":"We used an LSTM to detect when a smartphone walks into a building.
