Distributed prioritized experience replay, also submitted to ICLR). However this other work focuses primarily on discrete-action tasks.\n\nVideos of the parkour performance can be found at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFU7BiIwAjPDqsIL9OLm1z7_RXZA1Jyfj.\n\nWe have also found that the distributional model helps most in harder, higher-dimensional tasks. The main characteristic these tasks seem to share is the time/data required with which the solve the task. Potentially due to the complexity of learning the Q-function.\n\nWe found in general, for both distributional and non-distributional, that the 5-step version provided better results. Although this is not fully corrected for (see answers to the above reviewers) we found this to experimentally provide quite a bit of benefit to all variations of the algorithm.\n\nWe used 51 atoms across all tasks except for the humanoid parkour task which used 101. The level of resolution necessary will depend on the problem under consideration, and controlled by the combination of the number of atoms as well as the V_{min,max} values, however we found this to be relatively robust. Here we changed the number of atoms for the humanoid task in order to keep the resolution roughly consistent with other tasks.\n\nThe V_min and V_max values are global values that bound the support of the distribution. However, you are correct that this is what requires the projection. When applying the Bellman operator to a distribution it will more than likely lie outside the bounds given by V_min/V_max, so we project in order to ensure that our distributions are always within these bounds. Again, we also found these values to be relatively robust and we generally set these given knowledge of the maximum immediate reward of the system.\n\nWe did not extensively experiment with increasing the exploration noise, but from preliminary experiments we saw that the algorithm was fairly robust to this value. Deviating from the values we used did not significantly hurt nor hinder the algorithm’s performance.\n\nThe poor performance of DDPG in these experiments is primarily due to the fact that DDPG is quite slow to learn. For the easier control suite tasks DDPG is actually a feasible algorithm if given enough time. However for the harder tasks (any of the humanoid tasks, manipulator, and parkour tasks) DDPG would take much too long to work effectively. Finally, one of the bigger problems DDPG has is that it can exhibit quite unstable learning which is not exhibited by D4PG.\n\nThe easy-ness of the humanoid stand task is more due to the fact that it has less complicated motions to make than any of the other humanoid tasks.\n\nThe wall-clock times are for 32 cores on separate machines. We found communication across machines to be fast enough that having them all be on the same machine was not a requirement.\n\nWe apologize that the description of the network architecture was poorly explained and will correct it. The networks have two branches, one of which process the the terrain info to produce a lower-dimensional hidden state before combining it with the proprioceptive information. Utilizing this second branch to process the proprioceptive information and reduce it to a smaller number of hidden units is what we refer to as “reducing its dimensionality” however we will explain this better.\n\nWe will also explain critic architecture and what we refer to as “heads” further. Here we refer to the “distributional output” component of the network as a head. In this way we can replace the Categorical output with a Mixture of Gaussians output as described in section A. By “head” we only mean this final component which takes the last set of hidden units, passes them through a linear layer, and outputs the parameters of a distribution.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Distributional Policy Gradients","abstract":"This work adopts the very successful distributional perspective on reinforcement learning and adapts it to the continuous control setting.

By better estimating the Q-function we directly impact the accuracy of the policy gradient. We will include further discussion of this.\n\nIt is true that the distributional version (D4PG) does not always out-perform the non-distributional version (D3PG). However this is typically on easier tasks. In the control suite of tasks the distributional version significantly out-performs on the acrobot, humanoid, and swimmer set of tasks. For manipulation tasks this holds for the hardest pickup and orient task. And finally for all parkour tasks. So for tasks that are already somewhat easy to solve there are limited immediate gains, but for harder tasks this update tends to help (and help significantly for the parkour tasks).\n\nThe choice of a higher N is suggested by algorithms such as A3C and Rainbow, among others. Note that the Rainbow algorithm (Rainbow: Combining Improvements in Deep Reinforcement Learning, Hessel et al, 2017) utilizes an off-policy Q-learning update with uncorrected n-step returns, in a very similar way to that used by D4PG. In order to fully correct for this we should be using an off-policy correction, which we have not used for reasons of efficiency (see our response to the next reviewer). However, experimentally we have shown that this minor modification helps quite significantly and can be used directly in any off-policy algorithm. In all of our experiments and across both distributional and non-distributional updates it tends to be better to use the higher N. We did find that increasing N much higher than N>5 tended to degrade performance, which makes sense as this would be more off-policy.

(previously used in DQN). Two modifications are also simple and well-known techniques. It would be nicer if the description in Section 3 is less straightforward by giving more justifications and analysis why and how distributional updates are necessary in the context of policy search methods like DDPG. \n\n- A positive side of the paper is a large set of evaluations on many different control and robotic tasks. For many tasks, D4PG performs better than the variant that does not use distributional updates (D3PG), however by not much. There are some tasks showing no-difference. On the other hand, the choice of N=5 in comparisons is hard to understand and lacks further experimental justifications. Different setting and new performance metrics (e.g. data efficiency, number of episodes in total) might also reveal more properties of the proposed methods.\n\n\n\n* Other minor comments:\n\n- Algorithm 1 consists of two parts but there are connection between them.

The additions investigated are distributional Bellman updates, N-step returns, and prioritized experience replay.\n\nThe paper does a good job of analyzing these effects on a wide range of continuous control tasks, from the standard benchmark suite, to hand manipulation, to complex terrain locomotion and I believe these results are valuable to the community.\n\nHowever, I have a concern about the soundness of using N-step returns in DDPG setting. When a sequence of length N is sampled from the replay buffer and used to calculate N-step return, this sequence is generated according a particular policy. As a result, experience is non-stationary - for the same state-action pair, early iterations of the algorithm will produce structurally different (not just due to stochasticity) N-step returns because the policy to generate those N steps has changed between algorithm iterations. So it seems to me the authors are using off-policy updates where strictly on-policy updates should be used. I would like some clarification from the authors on this point, and if it is indeed the case to bring attention to this point in the final manuscript.\n\nIt would also be useful to evaluate the effect of N for values other than 1 and 5, especially given the significance this addition has on performance. I can believe N-step returns are useful, possibly due to effectively enlarging simulation timestep, but it would be good to know at which point it becomes detrimental.\n\nI also believe \"Distributional Policy Gradients\" is an overly broad title for this submission as this work still relies on off-policy updates and does not tackle the problem of marrying distributional updates with on-policy methods. \"Distributional DDPG\" or \"Distributional Actor-Critic\" or variant perhaps could be more fair title choices?\n\nAside from these concerns, lack of originality of contributions makes it difficult to highly recommend the paper.

In section 4 Result you've describe a few important design choices:\n \n1) You've chosen a fixed Gaussian noise for exploration and made a statement that Ornstein-Uhlenbeck didn't add to performance in your experiments. which contradicts a known results for DDPG. Can you provide a comparison plots and describe an experimental set-up supporting this statement for D4PG?\n2) You've chosen the same learning rate for actor and critic, what is a bit different from common practice for DDPG, when a critic usually has leaning rate an order of magnitude higher the same for actor. What is a justification of such a choice? Can provide some experimental results showing performance of a few different choices of learning rates for actor and critic?\n\nIn 4.3, Parkour section you showed results of the evaluation of different variants of D4PG and D3PG and comparison vs PPO. But it's unclear what a performance level do they correspond:\n\n3) Can you provide a few videos of the final performance for best variants of D4PG and PPO for Walker2d and Humanoid?\n4) You compare with PPO in wall time and number of actors steps. But they are not the only possible metrics for comparison. Can you provide some insights on:\n        a) Maximum rewards: What is a maximum performance D4PG vs PPO? How maximum rewards achieved with this 2           algorithm can be compared if perform longer training?\n        b) Stability: PPO is known to be very stable algorithm, while DDPG is much more sensitive to the hyperparameters choice. How a stability of D4PG training can be compared to PPO?\n        c) Scalability: How well D4PG is scaling with increasing  number of parallel workers in comparison with PPO?\n5) Do you plan to release your implementation for D4PG?"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":2,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Distributional Policy Gradients","abstract":"This work adopts the very successful distributional perspective on reinforcement learning and adapts it to the continuous control setting.
