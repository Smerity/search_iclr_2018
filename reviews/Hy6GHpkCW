You mentioned Graves 2013, a work that we actually based our method on. Specifically: once we take away the encoder, and generate images unconditionally using the decoder model, it is identical to the autoregressive modelling approach taken in Graves 2013. The only minor difference is we needed to model the \"end of drawing\" probability and have appended the model to output that as well. You are right to mention that we should compare our encoder to a forward-only RNN, to see the metrics drop, although in practice we would argue that most practitioners would choose the bi-directional method from the onset especially when the length of the data becomes longer, and the architecture and task makes it possible to use a non-causal model.  For example, while Graves 2013 uses a unidirectional LSTM for decoder-only handwriting generation, Graves 2007 [1] uses a bidirectional LSTM for handwriting classification without comparing to a unidirectional one.\n\nYou make some great points about the metrics relating to the dataset.  We are particularly interested in how the diversity and multi-modality of these drawings relate to issues like novelty and interpretability. In our view, these human perception and generation issues are complex and important enough to warrant their own future paper(s). To make it more convenient for future work on this dataset, we have also standardized the format and limited each class to have exactly 70K samples, 2.5K validation and test samples, rather than using the full extent of the dataset. We hope this standardisation will encourage future experiments in not just generation, but also classification, and also examination into cultural biases, diversity, modes, and human performance.\n\n[1] A.

Using RDP, line strokes drawn very slowly (with many points) and drawn very swiftly with look similar after the simplification process. For example, if the user holds his or her finger on the screen in one location for many seconds while sketching something, many points will be generated at a single location, but the simplification method will collapse those points as a single point.

The presented algorithm sketch-rnn seems novel and significantly different from prior work.\nIn addition, the authors collected the largest sketch dataset, I know of. This is exciting as it could significantly push the state of the art in sketch understanding and generation. \n\nUnfortunately the evaluation falls short. If the authors were to push for their novel algorithm, I'd have expected them to compare to prior state of the art on standard metrics, ablate their algorithm to show that each component is needed, and show where their algorithm shines and where it falls short.\nFor ablation, the bare minimum includes: removing the forward and/or reverse encoder and seeing performance drop. Remove the variational component, and phrasing it simply as an auto-encoder. Table 1 is good, but not sufficient. Training loss alone likely does not capture the quality of a sketch.\nA comparison the Graves 2013 is absolutely required, more comparisons are desired.\nFinally, it would be nice to see where the algorithm falls short, and where there is room for improvement.\n\nIf the authors wish to push their dataset, it would help to first evaluate the quality of the dataset. For example, how well do humans classify these sketches? How diverse are the sketches? Are there any obvious modes? Does the discretization into strokes matter?\nAdditionally, the authors should present a few standard evaluation metrics they would like to compare algorithms on? Are there any good automated metrics, and how well do they correspond to human judgement?\n\nIn summary, I'm both excited about the dataset and new architecture, but at the same time the authors missed a huge opportunity by not establishing proper baselines, evaluating their algorithm, and pushing for a standardized evaluation protocol for their dataset. I recommend the authors to decide if they want to present a new algorithm, or a new dataset and focus on a proper evaluation.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"A Neural Representation of Sketch Drawings","abstract":"We present sketch-rnn, a recurrent neural network able to construct stroke-based drawings of common objects.

The authors propose that this is particularly interesting over generating pixel data as it emphasises more human concepts. I agree. The contribution of this paper of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, the paper introduces a large sketch dataset that future papers can rely on. Secondly, the paper introduces the model for generating sketch drawings.\n\nThe model is inspired by the variational autoencoder. However, the proposed method departs from the theory that justifies the variational autoencoder. I believe the following things would be interesting points to discuss / follow up:\n- The paper preliminarily investigates the influence of the KL regularisation term on a validation data likelihood. It seems to have a negative impact for the range of values that are discussed. However, I would expect there to be an optimum. Does the KL term help prevent overfitting at some stage? Answering this question may help understand what influence variational inference has on this model.\n- The decoder model has randomness injected in it at every stage of the RNN. Because of this, the latent state actually encodes a distribution over drawings, rather than a single drawing. It seems plausible that this is one of the reasons that the model cannot obtain a high likelihood with a high KL regularisation term. Would it help to rephrase the model to make the mapping from latent representation to drawing more deterministic? This definitely would bring it closer to the way the VAE was originally introduced.\n- The unconditional generative model *only* relies on the \"injected randomness\" for generating drawings, as the initial state is initialised to 0. This also is not in the spirit of the original VAE, where unconditional generation involves sampling from the prior over the latent space.\n\nI believe the design choices made by the authors to be valid in order to get things to work. But it would be interesting to see why a more straightforward application of theory perhaps *doesn't* work as well (or whether it works better). This would help interesting applications inform what is wrong with current theoretical views.\n\nOverall, I would argue that this paper is a clear accept.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"A Neural Representation of Sketch Drawings","abstract":"We present sketch-rnn, a recurrent neural network able to construct stroke-based drawings of common objects.
