The paradigm we consider is the RL equivalent of semi-supervised learning, with self-play being the unsupervised learning component. In this context, what matters is the number of labeled examples (analogously: target task episodes) used, rather than the number of unlabeled points (i.e. self-play episodes).

However, we would like to address several points raised:\n\n“Baranes and Oudeyer (2013) seems very close to the proposal in this paper. Given the existence of similar forms of self-play the key issue with paper I see is that there is no strong self-play baseline in the experimental evaluation”.\n- In B & O, one needs to construct a set of all possible tasks in the environment, and parameterize this set in such a way that it can be reasonably partitioned and sampled.  It is not obvious how to do this in our problems without using extra domain knowledge. In our approach, however, tasks are discovered by an agent acting in the environment, thus eliminating the need of domain knowledge about the environment. For this reason, we cannot directly compare to the approach of B & O and no other forms of self-play exist, as far as we are aware. \nAlso note that it is not clear how to obtain the same sorts of guarantees we get in the tabular setting (and the related intuitions about what the learning protocol is achieving) with their method.\n\n“Is it not possible for Alice to immediately find an easy task for her where Bob times out, gets no reward signal, and therefore is unable to learn anything? Then repeating that task will loop forever without progress. This suggests that the adversarial setting is quite brittle”.\n- An easy task means it only requires few actions for Alice to succeed. In repeat self-play, this means that Bob would only need a few actions to succeed also. So it is unlikely that Bob will keep failing on such easy tasks since even taking random actions would sometimes yield success on such easy tasks. The same is true for the reverse self-play because of the reversibility assumption (Bob just needs to perform the opposite of Alice's actions in reverse order).\nIn general however, our adversarial setting does assume that Alice and Bob are trained in sync. Similar to generative adversarial networks, if one of them gets too far ahead of the other, then it can impede training. However, our experiments demonstrate that the two of them can be successfully training is possible on non-trivial problems.\n\n“I also find that the paper is a little light on the technical side”.\n-We will add further technical details in the final revision."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Intrinsic Motivation and Automatic Curricula via Asymmetric Self-Play","abstract":"We describe a simple scheme that allows an agent to learn about its\n  environment in an unsupervised manner.

The first personality learns to generate goals for other personality for which the second agent is just barely capable--much in the same way a teacher always pushes just past the frontier of a student’s ability. The second personality attempts to achieve the objectives set by the first as well as achieve the original RL task.  \n\nThe novelty of the proposed method is introduction of a teacher that learns to generate a curriculum for the agent.The formulation is simple and elegant as the teacher is incentivised to widen the gap between bob but pays a price for the time it takes which balances the adversarial behavior. \n\nPrior and concurrent work on learning curriculum and intrinsic motivation in RL rely on GANs (e.g., automatic goal generation by Held et al.), adversarial agents (e.g., RARL by Pinto et al.), or algorithmic/heuristic methods (e.g., reverse curriculum by Florensa et al. and HER Andrychowicz et al.).  In the context of this work, the contribution is the insight that an agent can be learned to explore the immediate reachable space but that is just within the capabilities of the agent. HER and goal generation share the core insight on training to reach goals. However, HER does generate goals beyond the reachable it instead relies on training on existing reached states or explicitly consider the capabilities of the agent on reaching a goal. Goal generation while learning to sample from the achievable frontier does not ensure the goal is reachable and may not be as stable to train. \n\nAs noted by the authors the above mentioned prior work is closely related to the proposed approach. However, the paper only briefly mentions this corpus of work. A more thorough comparison with these techniques should be provided even if somewhat concurrent with the proposed method. The authors should consider additional experiments on the same domains of this prior work to contrast performance.\n\nQuestions:\nDo the plots track the combined iterations that both Alice and Bob are in control of the environment or just for Bob? \n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Intrinsic Motivation and Automatic Curricula via Asymmetric Self-Play","abstract":"We describe a simple scheme that allows an agent to learn about its\n  environment in an unsupervised manner.
