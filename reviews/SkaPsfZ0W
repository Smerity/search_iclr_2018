It made our work much better!\n\n* Compare with DCNN:\nWe added experiments to DCNN, and clearly explained how they are a special case of ours in new Section 3.6. We outperform them in the \"standard\" setup that was used by Kipf and Planetoid (i.e. 20 nodes per class). However, DCNN is showing more power than GCN's with more training data (e.g. see table on Pubmed, up to 100 labeled nodes).\n\n\n* Layers of GCN?\nThanks! We now made it clear in writing. Our GCN and SAGE modules for both our models and baselines use 2 layers.\n\n\n* Why replication r > 1?\nWe added extensive evaluation in Appendix. More \"r\" helps, similar to \"ensemble of classifiers\" (e.g. mixture of experts). This seems to help on validation+test but not on train accuracy, as all models reach ~100% accuracy on training anyway.\n\n\n* Early stopping and \"many runs\" for validation.\nWe beleive that model selection we do is acceptable. We choose models based on *validation* accuracy. In fact, we now choose the top 1 model based on validation accuracy and report its test accuracy, which is the true practical setting. We do many runs (total == thousands, for all parameter sweeps) and put mean and standard deviation in appendix. Also, we now re-ran all experiments without early stopping.\n\n\n* Add error bars to attention.\nGood idea. Now done. Thank you!\n\n\n* Self-connections:\nWe add self connections, and already mentioned it in at least 2 places as we follow Kipf's setup.\n\n\n* Understanding paper requires knowing Kipf's work\nWe tried to explain what it means that approximations \"still valid\". Is it better now? we tried our best to make the paper stand on its own and will continue doing so before the camera ready (in hopes it gets accepted)\n\n\n* Section 2.3 not needed.\nWe feel that it gives the reader background of embeddings on adjacency VS embeddings using random walks. It also gives us defines \\mathcal{T} in terms of D and A (which might be known by many readers and they could skim that section).\n\n\n* Typos:\nWe fixed them.

Potentially because these datasets over-fit, reaching 100% accuracy on training set in all cases.\nNonetheless, we tried mixture of experts on GCNs (i.e. K=1 but r>1), and it is better than K = r = 1, but not as good as ours using random walks. For example, look at appendix and scroll down, comparing every (K=1,r=4; i.e. mixture of GCN) with (K=4,r=1; ours), and you will find that ours is better in all cases, showing that random walks indeed help.\n\n\n* Calibration is not clean:\n\nYou are right.

Different GCNs utilize different powers of the transition matrix to capture varying neighborhoods in a graph. As an aggregation mechanism of the GCN modules two approaches are considered: a fully connected layer on top of stacked features and attention mechanism that uses a scalar weight per GCN. The later allows for better interpretability of the effects of varying degree of neighborhoods in a graph.\n\nProposed approach, as authors noted themselves, is quite similar to DCNN (Atwood and Towsley, 2016) and becomes equivalent if the combined GCNs have one layer each. While comparison to vanilla GCN is quite extensive, there is no comparison to DCNN at all. I would be curious to see at least portion of the experiments of the DCNN paper with the proposed approach, where the importance of number of GCN layers is addressed. DCNN did well on Cora and Pubmed when more training samples were used. It also was tested on graph classification datasets, but the results were not as good for some of the datasets. I think that comparison to DCNN is important to justify the importance of using multilayer GCN modules.\n\nSome questions and concerns:\n- I could not quite figure out how many layers did each GCN have in the experiments and how impactful is this parameter \n- Why is it necessary to replicate GCNs for each of the transition matrix powers? In section 4.3 it is mentioned that replication factors r = 1 and r = 4 were used, but it is not clear from Table 2 what are the results for respective r.\n- Early stopping implementation seems a bit too intense. \"We invoke many runs over all datasets\" - how many? Mean and standard deviation are reported for top 3 performers, which is not enough to get a sense of standard deviation and mean. Kipf and Welling (2017) report results over 100 runs without selecting top performers if I understood correctly their setup. Could you please report mean and standard deviation of all the runs? Given relatively small performance improvement (comparatively to GCN), more than 3 (selected) runs are needed for comparison.\n- I liked the attention idea and its interpretation in Fig. 2. Could you please add the error bars for the attention weights. It is interesting to see them shifting towards higher powers of the transition matrix, but also it is important to know if this phenomena is statistically significant.\n- Following up on the previous item - did you try not including self connections when computing transition matrix powers? This way the effect of different degrees of neighborhoods in a graph could be understood better. When self-connections are present, each subsequent transition matrix power contains neighborhoods of lower degrees and interpretation becomes not as apparent.\n\nMinor comments:\n- Understanding of this paper quite heavily relies on the reader knowing Kipf and Welling (2017) paper. Particularly, the comment about approximations derived by Kipf and Welling (2017) in Section 3.3 and how directed graph was converted to undirected (Section 4.1) require a bit more details.\n- I am not quite sure why Section 2.3 is needed. Connection to graph embeddings is not given much attention in the paper later on (except t-SNE picture).\n- Typo in Fig. 1 caption - right and left are mixed up.\n- Typo in footnote on page 3.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":2,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Network of Graph Convolutional Networks Trained on Random Walks","abstract":"Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are a recently proposed architecture which has had success in semi-supervised learning on graph-structured data.

Following https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907, the setting is typically as follows (as you mentioned): a small number of labeled examples are used for training (typically 20 labeled nodes per class), whereas a large fixed-size split of 500 labeled nodes is used for validation / hyperparameter optimization. \n\nWhile the hyperparameter optimization procedure in https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907 was kept to a bare minimum (same hyperparameter choice across all three datasets, chosen from a very small grid search on Cora), it is indeed possible to easily \"cheat\" the benchmark by making use of the rich information provided by the validation set, as your results denoted by 'calibrated' (where you perform gradient descent on some of the model parameters based on validation loss) nicely demonstrate. I am a bit worried that this issue affects a number of recently proposed models that make use of this benchmark (some of the other concurrent submissions to ICLR2018 included), as it is hard to evaluate how much effort has been put into hyperparameter optimization.\n\nIt looks to me like your uncalibrated model (i.e. without gradient descent optimization based on validation loss) is unaffected by this and indicates that your proposed Network of GCNs indeed helps improve model performance. \n\nRecently, a number of improvements of the GCN model have been proposed, and I think it would make your results stronger if you compared to the most prominent ones that have been published lately: GraphSAGE (https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02216) and mixture model CNNs (https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08402). Arguably their contributions are orthogonal to yours, so ideally these model improvements could easily be combined. Nonetheless it would provide a clearer picture to see how different contributions can make this class of model more powerful / stable.\n\nIt would be interesting to see an evaluation of your model on at least one different type of dataset (such as one of the benchmark datasets introduced in GraphSAGE), where calibration on the validation set hopefully wouldn't have such a large impact.\n\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":2,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Network of Graph Convolutional Networks Trained on Random Walks","abstract":"Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are a recently proposed architecture which has had success in semi-supervised learning on graph-structured data.
