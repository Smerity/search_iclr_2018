We would like to address the cons you listed in order:\n\n1. “The novelty of this paper is marginal.”:\nTo the best of our knowledge the contribution to NLP is completely novel. We actually consider our NLP results to be more important than our image recognition ones because (1) they use external unlabeled data instead artificially making the dataset semi-supervised (2) they are on more widely-used tasks and (3) although the past few years of development on consistency-cost-based and GAN-based semi-supervised learning methods have yielded gains in accuracy for image classification, they are not effective for sequence tagging (whereas our method is).\n\n“Leveraging the sub-regions of the image to improve performance is not new and has been widely-studied in image classification and retrieval.”\nWe believe leveraging sub-regions of the image to improve semi-supervised learning is novel, even though leveraging sub-regions has been used in prior works on supervised learning\n\n2. “The proposed approach suffers from a technical weakness or flaw.”\nThe reviewer’s comment on the technical flaw applies to image recognition, but not NLP. We also note even the smallest views in our model see a 21x21 region of the 32x32 images, so it is unlikely for a view to contain no representative concepts. But even aside from these two points we disagree with the criticism. This same “technical flaw” exists (although to a less degree) for any CNN with global mean pooling (an extremely common architecture). Like with our method, a mean-pooled CNN will encourage the feature vectors extracted from all patches of the image to be representative of the target class, not just the ones from the most salient patches. However, we think in many cases this is a good thing rather than a bad one: on difficult examples it is beneficial for the model to leverage the context surrounding the main part of the image (e.g., that an animal is standing in a field of grass) to better classify it (e.g., as a horse rather than a cat).\n\n3. “The word “view” in this paper is misleading. The “view” in this paper is corresponding to actually sub-regions in the images”\nA view being a sub-region of the image is true in the case of image recognition, but obviously not for NLP. We use “view” as a general term for particular subset of the input features. This usage of “view” is from Blum and Mitchell’s very influential paper “Combining Labeled and Unlabeled Data with Co-Training,” so “view” is terminology that has been around since 1998.\n\n4. “The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach fails to perform better than the compared baselines in table 2”\nCVT significantly outperforms our baselines. If the reviewer is using “baselines” to refer to prior work, we note (as we mention in the paper) that the TagLM model has far more parameters than ours (LSTMS with up to 8 times as many hidden units) and thus is also many times slower than ours for training and inference. When using a model with only twice as many hidden units as ours, their results drop to significantly below our numbers (see Table 6 in their paper). Therefore we believe their results are close to ours because their models are much larger, not because their method is equally effective."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Cross-View Training for Semi-Supervised Learning","abstract":"We present Cross-View Training (CVT), a simple but effective method for deep semi-supervised learning.

We would like to address the cons you listed:\n\n0. “There are no discussions of insights and why the proposed strategy work” \nWe discuss in the abstract and introduction why CVT works. To reiterate, there is a mutually beneficial relationship between the teacher and the students. The students can learn from the teacher because the teacher has access to more of each input and thus produces more accurate labels. Meanwhile, as the students learn they improve the representations for the parts of the input they are exposed to. These better representations in turn improve the teacher. In Section 4.1 under “Model Analysis” we present further insights into why the method works by analyzing the behavior of the trained models. \n\n“...for what cases it will work, and for what cases it will not work”\nWe believe CVT will be less effective if the views are too restricted (e.g., seeing very small patches of an input image, in which case the auxiliary prediction layers will not be able to learn effectively) or the views are too unrestricted (e.g., seeing almost the entire image, in which case the auxiliary layers will be very similar to the teacher and thus not be able to benefit from the teacher’s predictions).\n\n1. “The addition of auxiliary layers improves Sequence Tagging results marginally. “\n Although in absolute terms the gains are small, performance in sequence tagging is quite saturated, making large gains difficult to achieve. Looking at improvements over baselines in prior work, Wu et al., (2017) report gains of 0.3 for CCG and 0.05 for POS; Liu et al. (2017) report gains of 0.16 for Chunking, 0.49 for NER, and 0.09 for POS; Hashimoto et al. (2017) report gains of 0.75 for Chunking and 0.10 for POS-tagging; Peters et al. (2017), report gains of 1.37 for Chunking and 1.06 for NER. Therefore our gains (comparing “Baseline” vs “CVT” in Table 2) of 0.51 for CCG, 1.07 for Chunking, 0.80 for NER, and 0.11 for POS are pretty large in the context of sequence tagging research. We also note that the large gains from Peters et al. come from using a model many times bigger than ours. When they apply their method to a model more comparable to ours in size, their gains are smaller (see Table 6 of their paper).\n\n2. “The claim of cross-view for sequence tagging setting is problematic.”\nWe are not quite sure what the reviewer means by “problematic.” It is completely normal to leverage a token’s context (i.e., surrounding tokens) when making predictions for sequence tagging. Our “future’’ and “past” auxiliary losses improve this contextual information (which gets passed to the primary softmax layer through the BiLSTMs), resulting in better accuracy. \n\n3. “It is unfair to compare to the baseline models with much fewer parameters”\nThe extra parameters are only used at training-time, so we don’t think it’s an unfair comparison. The models have exactly the same expressive power because they have the same set of test-time parameters. We also note the additional layers only contain about 15% of the model’s parameters for image classification and about 5% for sequence tagging. \n\n4.  \"The \"CVT, no noise\" should be compared to \"CVT, random noise\"\"\nThis is a good point, and we will add that comparison! \n\n\"The current results show that the improvements are mostly from VAT, instead of CVT.\"\nAlthough the improvements for image recognition are larger for VAT than CVT, CVT still works well as a semi-supervised learning method on its own while training almost twice as fast as VAT (which requires two backwards passes for each minibatch instead of just one). We also note that we were unable to get VAT working for sequence tagging, so we believe our method has the advantage of being more applicable to NLP tasks. \n\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Cross-View Training for Semi-Supervised Learning","abstract":"We present Cross-View Training (CVT), a simple but effective method for deep semi-supervised learning.

Experiments were conducted on various data sets and experimental results were reported.\n\nPros:\n* Studying semi-supervised learning techniques for deep models is of practical significance.\n\nCons:\n* The novelty of this paper is marginal. The use of unlabeled data is in fact a self-training process. Leveraging the sub-regions of the image to improve performance is not new and has been widely-studied in image classification and retrieval. \n* The proposed approach suffers from a technical weakness or flaw. For the self-labeled data, the prediction of each view is enforced to be same as the assigned self-labeling. However, since each view related to a sub-region of the image (especially when the model is not so deep), it is less likely for this region to contain the representation of the concepts (e.g., some local region of an image with a horse may exhibit only grass); enforcing the prediction of this view to be the same self-labeled concepts (e.g,“horse”) may drive the prediction away from what it should be ( e..g, it will make the network to predict grass as horse). Such a flaw may affect the final performance of the proposed approach.\n* The word “view” in this paper is misleading. The “view” in this paper is corresponding to actually sub-regions in the images\n* The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach fails to perform better than the compared baselines in table 2, which reduces the practical significance of the proposed approach. \n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Cross-View Training for Semi-Supervised Learning","abstract":"We present Cross-View Training (CVT), a simple but effective method for deep semi-supervised learning.
