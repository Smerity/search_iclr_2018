At the same time, we do agree that it should be possible to add gradient observations into the inference used by an existing multi-fidelity method, although this is not discussed elsewhere.  For this reason, we have removed this sentence.\n\nWe also note that Wu et al. 2017 cited in our paper shows that simply adding gradient observation into GP inference with a standard acquisition function such as EI in the single-fidelity setting is not sufficient to provide a substantial performance improvement over the setting without gradient observations.  It is important to additionally modify the acquisition function to sample at points where gradient observations are particularly helpful.  For this reason we suspect that our method would outperform an existing multi-fidelity method whose inference but not acquisition function was modified to use gradients.  Since we do not do numerical experiments to confirm this fact, we do not discuss it in the paper.\n\nRegarding our claim that this is the first parallel multi-fidelity method, our response is similar: we believe this is true, as we searched the literature and did not find an existing paper that does this, but we do agree that this point does not need to be emphasized, and so we removed the sentence that claimed it.  Regarding the absence of parallel BO baselines, we have corrected this and now have two parallel BO baselines in our synthetic experiments as discussed below.\n\nAt the same time, when thinking about parallelizing an existing multi-fidelity method based on expected improvement or entropy search, ES tends to outperform EI in multi-fidelity settings, and ES is challenging to parallelize.  As far as we know, [1] is the only paper to do so, and its method incurs significant computational cost with no code publicly available.  It is perhaps for this reason that we were unable to find any previous papers or any publicly available software that supported multi-fidelity BO with batch evaluations, despite the apparent practical importance of this problem class.  Moreover, Hyperband is also difficult to parallelize due to its communication overhead, as discussed by the authors when leaving parallelization to future work.  Thus, we view developing an effective parallel multi-fidelity method, as we have done in this paper, as an important contribution.\n\nRegarding Figure 1: \nYes, cost here is wall-clock time.  Thus, batched algorithms tend to have smaller wall-clock times than sequential algorithms.  As per your suggestion we have added two additional parallel BO benchmarks: parallel EI and parallel KG.  We include them in Figure 1 in the revised version of the paper.  Batch cfKG outperforms both of these batch benchmarks.\n\n[1] Shah, Amar, and Zoubin Ghahramani. \"Parallel predictive entropy search for batch global optimization of expensive objective functions.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2015."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Continuous-fidelity Bayesian Optimization with Knowledge Gradient","abstract":"While Bayesian optimization (BO) has achieved great success in optimizing expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions, especially tuning hyperparameters of neural networks, methods such as random search (Li et al., 2016) and multi-fidelity BO (e.g. Klein et al.

We have not made the error in the implementation and the experiments are valid. We have corrected it in the revised version of the paper.  This should make section 3.3.2 more clear.\n\nThe cost function max_{1 <= i <= q} (cost(z_i)) is differentiable almost everywhere if cost(z) is differentiable everywhere.  The points of non-differentiability are those points where there are ties in the maximum.  Because they have measure 0, and our stochastic gradient estimator has continuous support (when the predictive distribution at the proposed points to sample is not degenerate), our stochastic gradient ascent algorithm encounters these points with probability 0 as long as it does not start at such a point.  We now discuss this in the revised version of the paper.\n\nWe take the cost function for tuning a neural network in section 4.2 and 4.3 to be the number of training examples used during the training process divided by the original number of training examples.  For example, if we subsample 10,000 training points (out of 50,000) per epoch, and train with 20 epochs, then the cost is 10,000*20/50,000 = 4. This definition is analogous to the resource R in the Hyperband paper. We take the cost function for kernel learning in the synchronous setting to be the wall-clock time. In batch settings, we take the cost to be max_{1 <= i <= q} (cost(z_i)), modeling the wall-clock that one would have when running jobs in parallel."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Continuous-fidelity Bayesian Optimization with Knowledge Gradient","abstract":"While Bayesian optimization (BO) has achieved great success in optimizing expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions, especially tuning hyperparameters of neural networks, methods such as random search (Li et al., 2016) and multi-fidelity BO (e.g. Klein et al.

Broadly speaking, the idea is\nto allow fidelity to be represented as a point in a hypercube and then\ninclude this hypercube as a covariate in the Gaussian process.

The sequential\ncfKG algorithm should always be able to make better decisions with its\nremaining budget than 8-cfKG.

Furthermore, cfKG can be generalized, following Wu et al. (2017), to settings where derivatives are available in the optimization process, e.g. large-scale kernel learning, and where more than one point can be evaluated simultaneously. Numerical experiments show that cfKG outperforms state-of-art algorithms when optimizing synthetic functions, tuning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on CIFAR-10 and SVHN, and in large-scale kernel learning.","pdf":"/pdf/c1999e798746966f4ae1c1aa61a61b1b1f9beb03.pdf","TL;DR":"We propose a Bayes-optimal Bayesian optimization algorithm for hyperparameter tuning by exploiting cheap approximations.","paperhash":"anonymous|continuousfidelity_bayesian_optimization_with_knowledge_gradient","_bibtex":"@article{\n  anonymous2018continuous-fidelity,\n  title={Continuous-fidelity Bayesian Optimization with Knowledge Gradient},\n  author={Anonymous},\n  journal={International Conference on Learning Representations},\n  year={2018},\n  url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SknC0bW0-}\n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper746/Authors"],"keywords":["Continuous fidelity","Bayesian optimization","fast","knowledge gradient","hyperparameter optimization"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":7,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"}],"limit":2000,"offset":0}
