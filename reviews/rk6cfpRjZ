ISS approach can learn an “optimal” structure whose accuracy is better than the same “optimal” model but trained without using group Lasso.\nFor example, in Table 1, the first model learned by ISS approach has “optimal” structure with hidden sizes of (373, 315), and its perplexity is better than the same model (in the last row) but trained without using group Lasso regularization.\n\n2. With the same dropout (keep ratio 0.6), the baseline model overfits, and, with early stop, the best validation perplexity is 97.73 which is worse than the original 82.57.\n\n3.

Instead of plotting the histogram of all weights, we plot the histogram of vector lengths of each “ISS weight groups”. We suppose it is more interesting because group Lasso essentially squeezes the length of each vector. The plot shows that the histogram is shifted to zeros by group Lasso regularization.\n\n6. Yes, to reduce the number of hyper-parameters, an identical \\lambda is used for all groups.\nWe tried to linearly scale the strength of regularization on each group by the vector length of the “ISS group weight” as used by Alvarez et al. 2016, however, it didn’t help to improve sparsity in our experiments.\n\n7.

The authors present experiments on unidirectional and bidirectional LSTM models which demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. The proposed techniques are evaluated on two models: a fairly large LSTM with ~66.0M parameters, as well as a more compact LSTM with ~2.7M parameters, which can be sped up significantly through compression.\nOverall this is a clearly written paper that is easy to follow, with experiments that are well motivated. To the best of my knowledge most previous papers in the area of RNN compression focus on pruning or compression of the node outputs/connections, but do not focus as much on reducing the computation/parameters within an RNN cell. I only have a few minor comments/suggestions which are listed below:\n\n1. It is interesting that the model structure where the number of parameters is reduced to the number of ISSs chosen from the proposed procedure does not attain the same performance as when training with a larger number of nodes, with the group lasso regularizer. It would be interesting to conduct experiments for a range of \\lambda values: i.e., to allow for different degrees of compression, and then examine whether the model trained from scratch with the “optimal” structure achieves performance closer to the ISS-based strategy, for example, for smaller amounts of compression, this might be the case?\n\n2. In the experiment, the authors use a weaker dropout when training with ISS. Could the authors also report performance for the baseline model if trained with the same dropout (but without the group LASSO regularizer)?\n\n3. The colors in the figures: especially the blue vs. green contrast is really hard to see. It might be nicer to use lighter colors, which are more distinct.\n\n4. The authors mention that the thresholding operation to zero-out weights based on the hyperparameter \\tau is applied “after each iteration”. What is an iteration in this context? An epoch, a few mini-batch updates, per mini-batch? Could the authors please clarify.\n\n5. Clarification about the hyperparameter \\tau used for sparsification: Is \\tau determined purely based on the converged weight values in the model when trained without the group LASSO constraint? It would be interesting to plot a histogram of weight values in the baseline model, and perhaps also after the group LASSO regularized training.\n\n6. Is the same value of \\lambda used for all groups in the model? It would be interesting to consider the effect of using stronger sparsification in the earlier layers, for example.\n\n7.
