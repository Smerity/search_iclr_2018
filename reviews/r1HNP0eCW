The motivation of the problem and applications are presented well, especially for news recommender systems.\n\nHowever, there are no novel scientific contributions. The idea of fusing standard bi-LSTM layers coupled with a dense fully-connected layer alone is not a substantial technical contribution. Did they try other deep architectures for the task? The authors cite some previous works to explain their choice of approach for this task. A detailed analysis of different architectures (recurrent and others) on the specifc task would have been more convincing. \n\nComparison against other relevant baselines (including other cross-lingual retrieval approaches) is missing. There are several existing works on learning cross-lingual word embeddings (e.g., Mikolov et al., 2013). Some of these also make available pre-trained embeddings in multiple languages. You could combine them to learn cross-lingual semantic similarities for the retrieval task. How does your approach compare to these other approaches besides the Siamese LSTM baseline? \n\nOverall, it is unclear what the contributions are — there has been a lot of work in the NLP/IR literature on the same task, yet there is no detailed comparison against any of these relevant baselines. The technical contributions are also not novel or strong  to make the paper convincing. \n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Estimation of cross-lingual news similarities using text-mining methods","abstract":"Every second, innumerable text data, including all kinds news, reports, messages, reviews, comments, and twits have been generated on the Internet,  which is written not only in English but also in other languages such as Chinese, Japanese, French and so on.

Many real-world applications.\n2. Simple architecture and can be reproduced (if given enough details.)\n\n\nCons\n----------------------\n\n1. Ablation study showing whether bidirectional LSTM contributing to the similarity would be helpful.\n2. Baseline is not strong. How about using just LSTM?\n4. It is suprising to see that only concatenation with MLP is used for optimization of capturing regularities across languages. \n5. Equation-11 looks like softplus function more than vanilla ReLU.\n6. How are the similarity assessments made in the gold standard dataset. The cost function used only suggest binary assessments. Please refer to some SemEval tasks for cross-lingual or cross-level assessments. As binary assessments may not be a right measure to compare articles of two different lengths or languages.\n\nMinor issues\n------------\n\n1. SNS is meant to be social networking sites?\n2. In Section 2.2, it denote that 'as the figure demonstrates'. No reference to the figure.\n3. In Section 3, 'discussed in detail' pointed to Section 2.1 related work section. Not clear what is discussed in detail there.\n4. Reference to Google Translate API is wrong.\n\n\nThe paper requires more experimental analysis to judge the significance of the approach presented.\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Estimation of cross-lingual news similarities using text-mining methods","abstract":"Every second, innumerable text data, including all kinds news, reports, messages, reviews, comments, and twits have been generated on the Internet,  which is written not only in English but also in other languages such as Chinese, Japanese, French and so on.

The proposed architecture builds upon siamese RNN by Mueller and Thyagarajan. The proposed approach is evaluated on cross lingual bitext retrieval.\n\n* REVIEW SUMMARY * \n\nThis paper is hard to read and need proof-reading by a person proficient in English. The experiments are extremely limited, on a toy task. No other baseline than (Mueller and Thyagarajan, 2016) is considered. The related work section lacks important references. It is hard to find positive points that would advocate for a presentation at ICLR.\n\n* DETAILED REVIEW *\n\nOn related work, the authors need to consider related work on cross lingual retrieval, multilingual document representation:\n\nBai, Bing, et al. \"Learning to rank with (a lot of) word features.\" Information retrieval 13.3 (2010): 291-314. (Section 4).\n\nSchwenk, H., Tran, K., Firat, O., & Douze, M.

In ACL 2016\n\n...\n\nOn evaluation, the authors need to learn about standard retrieval evaluation metrics such as precision at top 10, etc and use them. For instance, this book will be a good read.\n\nBaeza-Yates, Ricardo, and Berthier Ribeiro-Neto. Modern information retrieval. Vol. 463. New York: ACM press, 1999.\n\nOn learning objective, the authors might want to read about learn-to-rank objectives for information retrieval, for instance, \n\nLiu, Tie-Yan. \"Learning to rank for information retrieval.\" Foundations and Trends in Information Retrieval 3.3 (2009): 225-331.\n\nBurges, Christopher JC. \"From ranknet to lambdarank to lambdamart: An overview.\" Learning 11, no. 23-581 (2010): 81.\n\nChapelle, Olivier, and Yi Chang. \"Yahoo! learning to rank challenge overview.\" Proceedings of the Learning to Rank Challenge. 2011.\n\nHerbrich, Ralf, Thore Graepel, and Klaus Obermayer. \"Large margin rank boundaries for ordinal regression.\" (2000).\n\nOn experimental setup, the authors want to consider a setup with more than 8k training documents. More importantly, ranking a document set of 1k documents is extremely small, toyish. For instance, (Schwenk et al 2017) search through 1.5 million sentences. (Bai, Bing, et al 2009) search through 140k documents. Since you mainly introduces 2 modifications with respect to (Mueller and Thyagarajan, 2016), i.e  (i) not sharing the parameters on both branch of the siamese and (ii) the fully connected net on top, I would suggest to measure the effect of each of them both on multilingual data and on the SICK dataset used in (Mueller and Thyagarajan, 2016).","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Estimation of cross-lingual news similarities using text-mining methods","abstract":"Every second, innumerable text data, including all kinds news, reports, messages, reviews, comments, and twits have been generated on the Internet,  which is written not only in English but also in other languages such as Chinese, Japanese, French and so on.
