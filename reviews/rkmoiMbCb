In their experiments, the authors conducted 5 runs of 65 settings each (table 2). To me this is enough. I think the authors are only trying to say \"It CAN be beneficial to shift parameters to the skip path\" not \"it IS beneficial to shift parameters to the skip path\". Of course, for any given dataset / architecture, keeping parameters on the residual path might be better. So for 100m parm network / ImageNet, the conclusion of the paper may not apply.

Hopefully the following will answer most of your questions. We'll also provide a follow-up later this week with code samples and tables of hyperparameter values.\n\n1. We do mean stride in the usual (spatial) sense. Much like pooling, it reduces the height and width of our image channels. When using identity connections or 1x1 convolutions, using stride 2 simply amounts to taking the sub-image of pixels with even coordinates.\n\nAs you observe, this needs to happen on both the linear and nonlinear sides of a block so that they can be added together. When there are two nonlinear layers in a block, we only change the stride on the first one.\n\n2. The specific initialization method we used was the 'variance scaling' method from the keras package, which uses a standard deviation of sqrt(scale/n) where n is the number of inputs to the layer (which is just the width of the previous layer). We determined the scale parameter experimentally, so we'll have to put together a list of the ones we ended up using for each experiment.\n\nExact values don't seem to be very important in this case. They just need to be large enough to get the network learning, but not so large that it becomes unstable. All of our values were between 0.3 and 1.2.\n\n3. We used a batch size of 125 for all experiments.\n\nAll of the data sets we used come with designated test sets that we used as such.\n\nFor our hyperparameter grid searches, we used 20% of the given training data as validation data and the remaining 80% as training data. We made sure that classes were equally represented in both the training and validation sets.\n\n4. Our weight decay and dropout values were a little different in each experiment, as dictated by our grid search. We'll make tables of these for you and get them to you soon. However, you may also want to perform your own grid searches for these values. We tried weight decay values from 0.0000 to 0.0004 and dropout rates from 0.0 to 0.3 for each experiment. \n\n5. For data augmentation, we only used shifts (both vertical and horizontal) and flips (only horizontal).

We feel that we have substantially improved the paper as a result of this review and the other two.\n\nFirst, it is important to note that we aren't replacing identity shortcuts so much as generalizing them. Tandem blocks include standard (identity) residual blocks as a special case. An identity shortcut is just a 1x1 convolution without non-linearity whose weight matrix is fixed as an identity matrix. The intent of our paper is to show that the latter property is unnecessary and limiting. The weight matrix of the linear shortcut doesn't need to be fixed (it can be learnable) and it doesn't need to be an identity matrix (either at initialization or after training). The linear convolution doesn't even need to be 1x1, which is particularly surprising. Because a number of notable papers contain assertions to the contrary (that identity connections are necessary and/or optimal), we believe that our contribution is both new and important. However, we failed to clearly express this and have revised the paper accordingly.\n\nSecond, it is important to make clear that we didn’t just switch identity connections to linear connections, rather we also reduced the number of neurons per layer in the linear case so that the total number of parameters did not increase in our comparisons.  In other words, we narrowed the layers to make the contests fair.  This wasn’t as clear as it could have been in the initial version of the paper.  We hope it is clearer now.\n\nTo address the reviewer’s question about learning rates, we did do a grid search across a number of learning rate schedules, testing them separately for each architecture, and (surprisingly) the same rate schedule turned out to be optimal for every architecture. In Section 3 we clarified our approach.  We also clarified how we performed the searches for dropout and weight decay parameters, which convinced us to use different values for different architectures; see Section 3 for details.\n\nResponse to Other Comments:\n\nThe comment about learning from the zero map has been clarified to indicate that we initialized weights with small Gaussian values, as is standard practice.\n\nWe removed the paragraph about tandem networks acting as ensembles of shallower networks, per the reviewer's suggestion. We removed the paragraph about removing nonlinearities for the same reason and Section 2 is clearer as a result.\n\nWe should clarify that our results are competitive with those achieved in other ResNet papers. We mention this primarily to establish that we correctly recreated their architectures for our experiments, making the comparisons fair.

We aren't replacing identity shortcuts so much as generalizing them. Tandem blocks include standard (identity) residual blocks as a special case. An identity shortcut is just a 1x1 convolution without non-linearity whose weight matrix is fixed as an identity matrix. The intent of our paper is to show that the latter property is unnecessary and limiting. The weight matrix of the linear shortcut doesn't need to be fixed (it can be learnable) and it doesn't need to be an identity matrix (either at initialization or after training). The linear convolution doesn't even need to be 1x1, which is particularly surprising. Because a number of notable papers contain assertions to the contrary (that identity connections are necessary and/or optimal), we believe that our contribution is both new and important. However, we failed to clearly express this and have revised the paper accordingly.  We are grateful to the reviewer for pointing out the weaknesses of the submitted draft.\n\nThe linked paper (“Identity Mappings in Deep Residual Networks” by He et al.) does explore the idea of using learnable linear 1x1 convolutions instead of identity mappings, as does the original ResNet paper. Both conclude that identity connections are superior on the grounds that they work better in extremely deep networks because they don't scale gradients. We did not intend to claim to be the first to use linear 1x1s in this way. Instead, our primary aim was to challenge the conclusion that identity connections are superior.  We have now clarified this in the revised paper.\n\nMuch of the initial explanation for why identity shortcut connections were important had to do with building extremely deep networks. However, Zagoruyko and Komodakis showed that wider, shallower networks are superior even with traditional resblocks (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07146.pdf). So it's important to ask what types of shortcut connections work best in these cases.\n\nIn reading this review, it was clear that we needed to explain more thoroughly our experimental procedures, including our use of train/val/test splits and hyperparameter grid search.  As is traditional, we do not use the test set for hyperparameter selection, but rather a separate validation set.  The test set is only used for final evaluation. We hope this is now clear in the paper.\n\nUnfortunately, we don't have a good explanation for the effects of batch normalization in our experiments. We expected it to help, but this simply wasn't what we observed. This question certainly merits further investigation.\n\nWe should clarify that our results are competitive with those achieved in other ResNet papers. We mention this primarily to establish that we correctly recreated their architectures for our experiments, making the comparisons fair. Our networks may not beat more complex architectures (such as Inception) on a per-parameter basis, but that isn't the goal. We're only investigating the question of shortcut connections, so we tried not to introduce any extra variables.\n\nThe differences between architectures in some experiments were indeed too small to indicate that one architecture was better than another, and we don't want to imply otherwise. Our goal is to show that non-identity connections were better than identities in some experiments and comparable in others. Both cases contradict the near-universal assertions that identity connections are somehow special or optimal.  It is important to make clear that we didn’t just switch identity connections to linear connections, rather we also reduced the number of neurons per layer so that the total number of parameters did not increase in our comparisons.  In other words, we narrowed the layers to make the contests fair.\n\nWe would love to provide results on larger datasets, however, our computational resources are an issue. Testing extremely deep networks would also be interesting, but we would expect to observe the same thing as everyone else—that extremely deep networks take much longer to train and offer at best marginally better performance.\n\nWe have referenced and discussed all of the figures explicitly in the revised text.\n\nIMPORTANT:  At the reviewer's suggestion, we confirmed using the singular value decomposition that linear connections with standard initializations (zero mean and small variance) did not learn identity maps and that linear connections initialized to the identity did not stay there.  In other words, these maps are truly non-identity in nature.  This was an excellent suggestion from the reviewer and has (in our opinion) substantially strengthened our argument and the paper.\n\nWe noted that dropout is a kind of regularization, this and the typos are fixed."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Tandem Blocks in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","abstract":"Due to the success of residual networks (resnets) and related architectures, shortcut connections have quickly become standard tools for building convolutional neural networks.

We feel that we have substantially improved the paper as a result of this review and the other two.\n\nFollowing the reviewers comments, we have clarified that we aren't contrasting residual blocks with tandem blocks. It is more accurate to say that tandem blocks generalize residual blocks, including identity connections as a special case.\n\nThe paper “Identity Mappings in Deep Residual Networks” by He et al does explore the idea of using learnable linear 1x1 convolutions instead of identity mappings, as does the original ResNet paper. Both conclude that identity connections are superior on the grounds that they work better in extremely deep networks because they don't scale gradients. We did not intend to claim to be the first to use linear 1x1s in this way. Instead, our primary aim was to challenge the conclusion that identity connections are superior. We have now clarified this and discussed the relevant papers in the revised paper.\n\nMuch of the initial explanation for why identity shortcut connections were important had to do with building extremely deep networks. However, Zagoruyko and Komodakis showed that wider, shallower networks are superior even with traditional resblocks (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07146.pdf). So it's important to ask what types of shortcut connections work best in these cases. Our experiments show that learnable linear connections are as good as or better than identity connections in networks of practical size.\n\nIn reading this review, it was clear that we needed to explain more thoroughly our experimental procedures, including our use of train/val/test splits and hyperparameter grid search.   As is traditional, we do not use the test set for hyperparameter selection, but rather a separate validation set.  The test set is only used for final evaluation. We hope this is now clear in the paper.\n\nWe have fixed an incorrect statement to reflect the fact that identity connections don't prevent exploding gradients.  We thank the reviewer for calling that to our attention.\n\nIt is important to differentiate between network capacity and network depth. Zagoruyko and Komodakis used networks of tremendous capacity (but not particularly great depth) and outperformed the original ResNets which were much deeper. We would love to provide results for much larger networks (in terms of parameter count) and also on larger datasets. However, our computational resources are an issue. Testing extremely deep networks would also be interesting, but we would expect to observe the same thing as everyone else—that extremely deep networks take much longer to train and offer at best marginally better performance."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Tandem Blocks in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","abstract":"Due to the success of residual networks (resnets) and related architectures, shortcut connections have quickly become standard tools for building convolutional neural networks.

The paper investigates the importance of having the identity skip connections in residual block. The authors hypothesize that changing the identity mapping into a linear function would be beneficial. The main contribution of the paper is the Tandem Block, that is composed of two paths, linear and nonlinear, the outcome of two paths is summed at the end of the block. Similarly, as for residual blocks in ResNets, one can stack together multiple Tandem Blocks. However, this contribution seems to be rather limited. He at. al. (2016) introduces a Tandem Block like structure, very similar to B_(1x1)(2,w), see Fig. 2(e) in He at. al. (2016). Moreover, He et. al (2016) shows in Tab 1 that for a ResNet 101 this tandem like structure performs significantly worse than identity skip connections. This should be properly mentioned, discussed and reflected in the contributions of the paper. \n\nResult section: \nMy main concern is that it seems that the comparison of different Tandem Blocks designs has been performed on test set (e. g.

The authors hypothesize that the success of shortcut connections comes from the combination of linear and non-linear features at each layer and propose to substitute the identity shortcuts with a convolutional one (without non-linearity). This alternative is referred to as tandem block. Experiments are performed on a variety of image classification tasks such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN and Fashion MNIST.\n\nThe paper is well structured and easy to follow. The main contribution of the paper is the comparison between identity skip connections and skip connections with one convolutional layer.\n\nMy main concerns are related to the contribution of the paper and experimental pipeline followed to perform the comparison. First, the idea of having convolutional shortcuts was already explored in the ResNet paper (see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.05027.pdf). Second, given Figures 3-4-5-6, it would seem that the authors are monitoring the performance on the test set during training. Moreover, results on Table 2 are reported as the ones with “the highest test accuracy achieved with each tandem block”. Could the authors give more details on how the hyperparameters of the architectures/optimization were chosen and provide more information on how the best results were achieved?\n\nIn section 3.5, the authors mention that batchnorm was not useful in their experiments, and was more sensitive to the learning rate value. Do the authors have any explanation/intuition for this behavior?\n\nIn section 4, authors claim that their results are competitive with the best published results for a similar number of parameters. It would be beneficial to add the mentioned best performing models in Table 2 to back this statement. Moreover, it seems that in some cases such as SVHN the differences between all the proposed blocks are too minor to draw any strong conclusions. Could those differences be due to, for example, luck in picking the initialization seed? How many times was each experiment run? If more than once, what was the std?\n\nThe experiments were performed on relatively shallow networks (8 to 26 layers). I wonder how the conclusions drawn scale to much deeper networks (of 100 layers for example) and on larger datasets such as ImageNet.\n\nFigures 3-5 are not referenced nor discussed in the text.\n\nFollowing the design of the tandem blocks proposed in the paper, I wonder why the tandem block B3x3(2,w) was not included.\n\nFinally, it might be interesting to initialize the convolutions in the shortcut connections with the identity, and check what they have leant at the end of the training.\n\nSome typos that the authors might want to fix:\n\n- backpropegation -> backpropagation (Introduction, paragraph 3)\n- dropout is a kind of regularization as well (Introduction, second to last paragraph)\n- nad -> and (Sect 3.1. paragraph 1)\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Tandem Blocks in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","abstract":"Due to the success of residual networks (resnets) and related architectures, shortcut connections have quickly become standard tools for building convolutional neural networks.

The authors find that in their experiments, performance improves. Therefore, the power of skip connections is due to their linearity rather than due to the fact that they represent the identity.\n\nOverall, the paper has a clear and simple message and is very readable. The paper contains a good amount of experiments, but in my opinion not quite enough to conclude that identity skip connections are inherently worse. The question is then: how non-trivial is it that tandem networks work? For someone who understands and has worked with ResNet and similar architectures, this is not a surprise. Therefore, the paper is somewhat marginal but, I think, still worth accepting.\n\nWhy did you choose a single learning rate for all architectures and datasets instead of choosing the optimal one for each archtitecture and dataset? Was it a question of computational resources? Using custom step sizes would strenghten your experimental results significantly. In the absence of this, I would still ask that you create an appendix where you specify exactly how hyperparameters were chosen.\n\nOther comments:\n\n- \"and that it’s easier for a layer to learn from a starting point of keeping things the same (the identity map) than from the zero map\" I don't understand this comment. Networks without skip connections are not initialized to the zero map but have nonzero, usually Gaussian, weights.\n- in section 2, reason (ii), you seem to imply that it is a good thing if a network behaves as an ensemble of shallower networks. In general, this is a bad thing. Therefore, the fact that ResNet with tandom networks is an ensemble of shallower networks is a reason for why it might perform badly, not well. I would suggest removing reason (ii).\n- in section 3, reason (iii), you state that removing nonlinearities from the skip path can improve performance. However, using tandom blocks instead of identity skip connections does not change the number of nonlinearity layers. Therefore, I do not see how reason (iii) applies to tandem networks.\n- \"The best blocks in each challenge were competitive with the best published results for their numbers of parameters; see Table 2 for the breakdown.\" What are the best published results?
