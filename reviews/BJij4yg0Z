It does so from the perspective of \"Bayesian model comparison\", where two models are compared based on their \"marginal likelihood\" (aka, their \"evidence\" --- the expected probability of the training data under the model, when parameters are drawn from the prior).  It first shows that a simple weakly regularized (linear) logistic regression model over 200 dimensional data can perfectly memorize a random training set with 200 points, while also generalizing well when the class labels are not random (eg, when a simple linear model explains the class labels); this provides a much simpler example of a model generalizing well in spite of high capacity, relative to the experiments presented by Zhang et al (2017). It shows that in this very simple setting, the \"evidence\" of a model correlates well with the test accuracy, and thus could explain this phenomena (evidence is low for model trained on random data, but high for model trained on real data).\n\nThe paper goes on to show that if the evidence is approximated using a second order Taylor expansion of the cost function around a minimia $w_0$, then the evidence is controlled by the cost at the minimum, and by the logarithm of the ratio of the curvature at the minimum compared to the regularization constant (eg, standard deviation of gaussian prior).  Thus, Bayesian evidence prefers minima that are both deep and broad.  This provides a way of comparing models in a way which is independent of the model parametrization (unfortunately, however, computing the evidence is intractable for large networks). The paper then discusses how SGD can be seen as an algorithmic way of finding minima with large \"evidence\" --- the \"noise\" in the gradient estimation helps the model avoid \"sharp\" minima, while the gradient helps the model find \"deep\" minima.  The paper shows that SGD can be understood using stochastic differential equations, where the noise scale is approximately aN/((1-m)B) (a = learning rate, N = size of training set, B = batch size, m = momentum).  It argues that because there should be an optimal noise scale (which maximizes test performance), the batch size should be taken proportional to the learning rate, as well as the training set size, and proportional to 1/(1-m).  These scaling rules are confirmed experimentally (DNN trained on MNIST).  Thus, this Bayesian perspective can also help explain the observation that models trained with smaller batch sizes (noisier gradient estimates) often generalize better than those with larger batch sizes (Kesker et al, 2016). These scaling rules provide guidance on how to increase the batch size, which is desirable for increasing the parralelism of SGD training.\n\nReview:\nQuality: The quality of the work is high.  Experiments and analysis are both presented clearly.\n\nClarity: The paper is relatively clear, though some of the connections between the different parts of the paper felt unclear to me:\n1) It would be nice if the paper were to explain, from a theoretical perspective, why large evidence should correspond to better generalization, or provide an overview of the work which has shown this (eg, Rissanen, 1983).\n2) Could margin-based generalization bounds explain the superior generalization performance of the linear model trained on random vs. non-random data?  It seems to me that the model trained on meaningful data should have a larger margin.\n3) The connection between the work on Bayesian evidence, and the work on SGD, felt very informal. The link seems to be purely intuitive (SGD should converge to minima with high evidence, because its updates are noisy).  Can this be formalized?  There is a footnote on page 7 regarding Bayesian posterior sampling -- I think this should be brought into the body of the paper, and explained in more detail.\n4) The paper does not give any background on stochastic differential equations, and why there should be an optimal noise scale 'g', which remains constant during the stochastic process, for converging to a minima with high evidene.  Are there any theoretical results which can be leveraged from the stochastic processes literature? For example, are there results which prove anything regarding the convergence of a stochastic process under different amounts of noise?\n5) It was unclear to me why momentum was used in the MNIST experiments.  This seems to complicate the experimental setting.  Does the generalization gap not appear when no momentum is used?  Also, why is the same learning rate used for both small and large batch training for Figures 3 and 4?  If the learning rate were optimized together with batch size (eg, keeping aN/B constant), would the generalization gap still appear?  Figure 5a seems to suggest that it would not appear (peaks appear to all have the same test accuracy).\n6) It was unclear to me whether the analysis of SGD as a stochastic differential equation with noise scale aN/((1-m)B) was a contribution of this paper.  It would be good if it were made clearer which part of the mathematical analysis in sections 2 and 5 are original.\n7) Some small feedback: The notation $< x_i > = 0$ and $< x_i^2 > = 1$ is not explained.  Is each feature being normalized to be zero mean, unit variance, or is each training example being normalized?\n\nOriginality: The works seems to be relatively original combination of ideas from Bayesian evidence, to deep neural network research.  However, I am not familiar enough with the literature on Bayesian evidence, or the literature on sharp/broad minima, and their generalization properties, to be able to confidently say how original this work is.\n\nSignificance: I believe that this work is quite significant in two different ways:\n1) \"Bayesian evidence\" provides a nice way of understanding why neural nets might generalize well, which could lead to further theoretical contributions.\n2) The scaling rules described in section 5 could help practitioners use much larger batch sizes during training, by simultaneously increasing the learning rate, the training set size, and/or the momentum parameter.  This could help parallelize neural network training considerably.\n\nSome things which could limit the significance of the work:\n1) The paper does not provide a way of measuring the (approximate) evidence of a model.  It simply says it is prohibitively expensive to compute for large models.  Can the \"Gaussian approximation\" to the evidence (equation 10) be approximated efficiently for large neural networks?\n2) The paper does not prove that SGD converges to models of high evidence, or formally relate the noise scale 'g' to the quality of the converged model, or relate the evidence of the model to its generalization performance.\n\nOverall, I feel the strengths of the paper outweight its weaknesses.  I think that the paper would be made stronger and clearer if the questions I raised above are addressed prior to publication.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"A Bayesian Perspective on Generalization and Stochastic Gradient Descent","abstract":"This paper tackles two related questions at the heart of machine learning; how can we predict if a minimum will generalize to the test set, and why does stochastic gradient descent find minima that generalize well?

","rating":"3: Clear rejection","review":"The paper takes a recent paper of Zhang et al 2016 as the starting point to investigate the generalization capabilities of models trained by stochastic gradient descent. The main contribution are scaling rules that relate the batch size k used in SGD with the learning rate \\epsilon, most notably \\epsilon/k = const for optimal scaling.\n\nFirst of all, I have to say that the paper is very much focussed on the aforementioned paper, its experiments as well as its (partially speculative) claims. This, in my opinion, is a biased and limited starting point, which ignores much of the literature in learning theory. \n\nChapter 2 provides a sort of a mini-tutorial to (Bayesian) model selection based on standard Bayes factors. I find this of limited usefulness. First of all, I find the execution poor in the details: \n(i) Why is \\omega limited to a scalar? Nothing major really depends on that. Later the presentation switches to a more general case. \n(ii) What is a one-hot label? \"One-hot\" is the encoding of a categorical label. \n(iii) In which way is a Gaussian prior uncorrelated, if there is just a scalar random variable? \n(iv) How can one maximize a probability density function? \n(v) Why is an incorrect \"pseudo\"-set notation used instead of the correct vectorial one? \n(vi) \"Exponentially large\", \"reasonably prior\" model etc. is very vague terminology\n(vii) No real credit is given for the Laplace approximation presented up to Eq. 10. For instance, why not refer to the seminal paper by Kass & Raferty? Why spend so much time on a step-by-step derivation anyway, as this is all \"classic\" and has been carried out many times before (in a cleaner write-up)? \n(viii) \"P denotes the number of model parameters\" (I guess it should be a small p? hard to decipher)\n(ix) Usually, one should think of the Laplace approximation and the resulting Bayes factors more in terms of a \"volume\" of parameters  close to the MAP estimate, which is what the matrix determinant expresses, more than any specific direction of \"curvature\". \n\nChapter 3 constructs a simple example with synthetic data to demonstrate the effect of Bayes factors. I feel the discussion to be too much obsessed by the claims made in Zhang et al 2016 and in no way suprising. In fact, the \"toy\" example is so much of a \"toy\" that I am not sure what to make of it. Statistics has for decades successfully used criteria for model selection, so what is this example supposed to proof (to whom?).\n\nChapter 4 takes the work of Mandt et al as a starting point to understand how SGD with constant step size effectively can be thought of as gradient descent with noise, the amplitude of which is controlled by the step size and the mini-batch size. Here, the main goal is to use evidence-based arguments to distinguish good from poor local minima. There is some experimental evidence presented on how to resolve the tradeoff between too much noise (underfitting) and too little (overfitting).\n\nChapter 5 takes a stochastic differential equation as a starting point. I see several issues:\n(i) It seems that you are not doing much with a SDE, as you diredctly jump to the discretized version (and ignore discussions of it's discretization). So maybe one should not feature the term SDE so prominently.\n(ii) While it is commonly done, it would be nice to get some insights on why a Gaussian approx. is a good assumption. Maybe you can verify this experimentally (as much of the paper consists of experimental findings)\n(iii) Eq. 13. Maybe you want this form to indicate a direction you want to move towards,  by I find adding and subtracting the gradient in itself not a very interesting manner of illustartion.\n(iv) I am not sure in whoch way g is \"measured\", but I guess you are determining it by comparing coefficients. \n(v) I am confused by the B_opt \\propto \\eps statement. It seems you are scaling to mini-batrch gradient to be in expectation equal to the full gradient (not normalized by N), e.g. it scales ~N. Now, if we think of a mini-batch as being a batched version of single pattern updates, then clearly the effective step length should scale with the batch size, which - because of the batch size normalization with N/B - means \\epsilon needs to scale with B. Maybe there is something deeper going on here, but it is not obvious to me.\n(vi) The argument why B ~ N is not clear to me. Is there one or are just making a conjecture?\n\nBottom line: The paper may contribute to the current discussion of the Zhang et al 2016 paper, but I feel  it does not make a significant contribution to the state of knowledge in machine learning. On top of that, I feel the execution of the paper leaves much to be desired. \n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"A Bayesian Perspective on Generalization and Stochastic Gradient Descent","abstract":"This paper tackles two related questions at the heart of machine learning; how can we predict if a minimum will generalize to the test set, and why does stochastic gradient descent find minima that generalize well?

A typical rule of thumb is linear models can memorize roughly two labels per parameter. This is also exactly why the deep networks in Zhang et al. can memorize random labels of their training data; they also have more parameters than training examples. In both linear and deep networks, if we made the training set sufficiently large we wouldn't be able to memorize randomly labelled data. I did a quick check and our model can memorize about 300 labels, it can't memorize 500.\n\nWhat surprised Zhang et al. is that the model did generalize well to the test set when trained on real informative labels, even though they had shown that the model was sufficiently flexible to assign random labels to the same inputs (ie meaningless solutions which do not generalize do exist). Again, we show exactly the same phenomenon here. The purpose of showing these results in a linear model is precisely to make these results intuitive, and to demonstrate that they should not be explained by any property unique to deep learning.\n\nWe show that good minima which generalize well to the test set can be distinguished from bad minima which do not by evaluating the Bayesian evidence (also known as the marginal likelihood). This evidence is a weighted combination of the depth and breadth of a minimum, but it is invariant to model parameterization, which clarifies the recent debate surrounding sharp minima."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"A Bayesian Perspective on Generalization and Stochastic Gradient Descent","abstract":"This paper tackles two related questions at the heart of machine learning; how can we predict if a minimum will generalize to the test set, and why does stochastic gradient descent find minima that generalize well?
