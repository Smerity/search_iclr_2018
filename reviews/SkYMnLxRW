We clarify the questions below. \n\n“the paper states that with alpha_i=1 and kappa_i=1 the two attention mechanism are equivalent. The equations, however, tell a different story: the original MultiHead attention quickly aggregates all attention heads, while the proposed BranchedAttention adds another processing step, effectively adding depth to the model.”\nWe found that the equivalence statement is indeed untrue given the nonlinearity of the FFN layer and have removed it from our updated manuscript.. However, we emphasize that our modification does not add depth to the network. Each layer of the original Transformer network consists of three operations (ignoring the residual connections and layer normalization): computation of the attention head, concatenation of the heads and finally the FFN layer. Our proposed architecture is a replacement for the entire layer (consisting of all three operations) and not just the multi-head attention. In doing so, we also change the order of operations; unlike the Transformer which concatenates the heads and then projects them through a single FFN layer, we first use $M$ FFN layers, one for each of the heads, and then combine them. The FFN layers, in this case, will be of commensurately reduced sizes (the original dimension divided by the number of the branches). Owing to this, the original and proposed Transformer networks have the same depth and, barring the scalar (alpha, kappa) values, exactly the same number of trainable parameters. We apologize for the lack of clarity and have fixed our notation and added an explanation in our updated manuscript. Specifically, we have expressed and contrasted the original Transformer network in the notation of (5)--(7).\n\n“The numbers for the original transformer match the ones in Vaswani et al 2017, am I correct to assume that the authors did not rerun the tensor2tensor code and simply copied them from the paper?”\nThat is true. Having said that, we have experimented with the baseline on our (home-grown) implementation and found very similar metrics for the original Transformer as those reported by the authors. \n\n“Is all of the experimental setup the same as in Vaswani et al 2017? Are the results obtained using their tensor2tensor implementation, or are some hyperparameters different?”\nIt is the same as Vaswani et. al. We used the tensor2tensor code as foundation for our modified architecture and, other than the proposed branching mechanism, all else stayed the same. \n\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Weighted Transformer Network for Machine Translation","abstract":"State-of-the-art results on neural machine translation often use attentional sequence-to-sequence models with some form of convolution or recursion.

It would have been good to also add a motivation for doing this (for example, this idea can be interpreted as having a variable number of attention heads which can be blended in and out with a single learned parameter, hence making it easier to use the parameters where they are needed). Also, it would be interesting to see how important the concatenation weight and the addition weight are relative to each other -- do you possibly get the same results even without the concatenation weight? \n\nA suggested improvement: Please check the references in the introduction and see if you can find earlier ones -- for example, language modeling with RNNs has been done for a very long time, not just since 2017 which are the ones you list; similar for speech recognition etc. (which probably has been done since 1993!).\n\nAddition to the original review: Your added additional results table clarifies a lot, thank you. As for general references for RNNs, I am not sure Hochreiter & Schmidhuber 1997 is a good reference as this only points to a particular type of RNN that is used today a lot. For speech recognition there are many better citations as well, check the conference proceedings from ICASSP for papers from Microsoft, Google, IBM, which are the leaders in speech recognition technology.

(2017) to used branched attention with learned weights instead of concatenated attention, and achieve improved results on machine translation.\n\nUsing branches instead of a single path has become a hot architecture choice recently, and this paper applies the branching concept to multi-head attention. Weirdly, they propose using two different sets of weights for each branch: (a) kappa, which premultiplies the head before fully connected layers, and (b) alpha, which are the weights of the sum of the heads after the fully connected layers. Both weights have simplex constraints. A couple of questions about this:\n\n* What is the performance of only using kappa? Only alpha? Neither? What happens if I train only of them?\n* What happens if you remove the simplex constraints (i.e., don't have to sum to one, or can be negative)?\n* Why learn a global set of weights for the branch combiners? What happens if the weights are predicted for each input example? This is the MoE experiment, but where k = M (i.e., no discrete choices made).\n* Are the FFN layer parameters shared across the different heads?\n* At the top of page 4, it is said \"all bounds are respected during each training step by projection\". What does this mean? Is projected gradient descent used, or is a softmax used? If the former, why not use a softmax?\n* In Figure 3, it looks like the kappa and alpha values are still changing significantly before they are frozen. What happens if you let them train longer? On the same note, the claim is that Transformer takes longer to train. What is the performance of Transformer if using the same number of steps as the weighted Transformer?\n* What are the Transformer variants A, B, and C?\n\nWhile the results are an improvement over the baseline Transformer, my main concern with this paper is that the improved results are because of extensive hyperparameter tuning.

The equations, however, tell a different story: the original MultiHead attention quickly aggregates all attention heads, while the proposed BranchedAttention adds another processing step, effectively adding depth to the model.\n\nSince the BranchedAttention is the key novelty of the paper, I am confused by this contradiction and treat it as a fatal flaw of this paper (I am willing to revise my score if the authors explain the equations) - the proposed attention either adds a small amount of parameters (the alphas and kappas) that can be absorbed by the other weights of the network, and the added alphas and kappas are easier/faster to optimize, as the authors state in the text, or the BranchedAttention works as shown in the equations, and effectively adds depth to the network by processing each attention's result with a small MLP before combining multiple attention heads. This has to be clarified before the paper is published.\n\nThe experiment show that the proposed change speeds convergence and improves the results by about 1 BLEU point. However, this requires a different learning rate schedule for the introduced parameters and some non-standard tricks, such as freezing the alphas and kappas during the end of the training.\n\nI also have a questions about the presented results:\n1) The numbers for the original transformer match the ones in Vaswani et al 2017, am I correct to assume that the authors did not rerun the tensor2tensor code and simply copied them from the paper?\n2) Is all of the experimental setup the same as in Vaswani et al 2017? Are the results obtained using their tensor2tensor implementation, or are some hyperparameters different?\n\nDetailed review:\nQuality:\nThe equations and text in the paper contradict each other.\n\nClarity:\nThe language is clear, but the main contribution could be better explained.\n\nOriginality:\nThe proposed change is a small extension to the Neural Transformer model.\n\nSignificance:\nRather small, the proposed addition adds little modeling power to the network and its advantage may vanish with more data/different learning rate schedule.\n\nPros and cons:\n+ the proposed approach is a simple way to improve the performance of multihead attentional models.\n- it is not clear from the paper how the proposed extension works: does it regularize the model or dies it increase its capacity?","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Weighted Transformer Network for Machine Translation","abstract":"State-of-the-art results on neural machine translation often use attentional sequence-to-sequence models with some form of convolution or recursion.
