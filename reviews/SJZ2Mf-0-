We have fixed the typos, terms, and explanations in the paper and made it more accessible. We have also added inference times for representative tasks that are consistent with the savings in terms of the number of entities accessed during inference in Appendix A.2.\n\nAdaptive Memory Networks (AMN) presents a dynamic network design where entities from the input stories are stored in memory banks. Starting from a single bank, as the number of input entities increases, the network learns to create new banks as the entropy in a single bank becomes too high. Over a period of time, the network represents a hierarchical structure where entities are stored in different banks distanced by the question. During inference, AMN can answer the question with high accuracy for most bAbI tasks by just looking at a single bank.\n\nAMN presents a new design paradigm in memory networks. Unlike NTMs, where the network learns where to read/write to fine-grained address information, AMN only learns to write input entities to coarse-grained banks and entities reside within the bank. As a result, AMN is easier to train (e.g. does not require curriculum learning like NTMs) and does not require a separate sparsification mechanism like approximate nearest neighbors for inference efficiency.\n\nAMN is timely. It has been made possible with the recent progress in dynamic networks which allows input dependent network creation and efficiency in variable sized batching as well as recent tricks in deep networks towards learning discrete decision making with high accuracy.\n\nApart from saving inference times, AMN can learn to reason which specific entities contribute towards the final answer improving interpretability.

We have updated the draft with the inference time information in Appendix. This can be useful when questions (or hints) are available during the QA process (we describe the Amazon example in the Introduction). Your concern about memory creation on a per question basis in a memory network is a valid one. Therefore, we extend AMN to multiple questions as shown in the evaluation. Hence, given a list of questions, AMN can learn to construct a network architecture such that these questions can be answered quickly. Here, network construction costs are amortized for mutiple questions.\n\n2) In equation 9, depending on what ΠCtrl is used for, Q is a polymorphic function and will take on a different operation and ∗ will be a different input. Examples of such are given in the paper in the respective sections (4.2.2.1, 4.2.2.2) with the required details.\n\n3) The result is on the validation set. We share the frustration. However, this is how a majority of the past work is reported. We plan on providing variance and mean for Entnet, GGT-NN and our work in the final version of the paper.\n\n4) When the number of entities is large, inference slows down. It also reduces the accuracy in some cases since the final operation such as softmax is performed over a large number of entities and it can be difficult to train. Our model can be applied to other QA tasks such as VQA. Here, each entity can additionally include CNN feature output and inference costs can be reduced.\n\n5) Yes, we plan to release the code with the final version of the paper.\n\nWe have fixed all the minor comments as you mention in your review.

The use of the reparametrization trick to enable global differentiability is reminiscent of an ICLR'17 paper \"Learning graphical state transitions\". Compared to the latter, the current paper seems to offer a more tractable architecture and optimization problem that does not require strong supervision and should be much faster to train.\n\nUnfortunately, this is the best understanding I got from this paper, as it seems to be in such a preliminary stage that the exact operations of the SGRU are not parsable. Maybe the authors have been taken off guard by the new review process where one can no longer improve the manuscript during this 2017 review (something that had enabled a few paper to pass the 2016 review).\n\nAfter a nice introduction, everything seems to fall apart in section 4, as if the authors did not have time to finish their write-up. \n- N is both the number of sentences and number of word per sentence, which does not make sense.\n- i iterates over both the sentences and the words. \n\nThe critical SGRU algorithm is impossible to parse\n- The hidden vector sigma, which is usually noted h in the GRU notation, is not even defined\n- The critical reset gate operation in Eq.(6) is not even explained, and modified in a way I do not understand compared to standard GRU.\n- What is t?

All we get at the end of section 4.2 is \" After these steps are finished, all entities are passed through the strength modified GRU (4.1) to recompute question relevance.\"\n\nThe algorithm in Appendix A does  not help much.

The proposed model iteratively creates a shorter list of relevant entities such that the decoder can look at only a smaller set of entities to answer the given question. Authors show results in bAbi dataset.\n\nMy comments:\n\n1. While the proposed model is very interesting, I disagree with the claim that AMN has lower inference times. The memory creation happens only after reading the question and hence the entire process can be considered as part of inference. So it is not clear if there is a huge reduction in the inference time when compared to other models that the authors compare. However, the proposed model looks like a nice piece of interpretable reasoning module. In that sense, it is not any better than EntNet based on the error rate since EntNet is doing better than AMN in 15 out of 20 tasks. So it is not very clear what is the advantage of AMN over EntNet or other MANN architectures.\n\n2. Can you explain equation 9 in detail? What is the input to the softmax function? What is the output size of the softmax? I assume q produces a scalar output. But what is the input size to the q function?\n\n3. In the experiment, when you say “best of 10 runs”, is it based on a separate validation set? Please report the mean and variance of the 10 runs. It is sad that people just report best of multiple runs in the bAbi tasks and not report the variance in the performance. I would like to see the mean and variance in the performance.\n\n4. What happens when number of entities is large? Can you comment about how this model will be useful in situations other than reading comprehension style QA? \n\n5.
