In particular, the detailed list of areas for improvement have lead us to run additional experiments and make edits in the text that we believe have strengthened our work.\n\nLet us address your concerns and questions below.\n\n> analysis on the training process\n\nWe’ve updated Figure 6 in the paper to display Accuracy@1 in addition to Accuracy@6. We hope this metric plotted over each epoch gives a useful overview of the training process and some insight in how the model’s performance changes over time. \n\n> Do the authors have a sense for how sensitive these results are to different runs of the training process?\n\nWe ran six experiments with different random seeds and reported the mean and variance on their loss and accuracy in Appendix B, but would be open to include these values in the main text if this seems useful.\n\n> the transfer test set\n\nThere was not much to be gleaned from the transfer set besides the effect of the attention mechanism. We’re more explicit about saying so in Section 6.\n\n> the accuracy@K metric\n\nWe use this metric since many mammal classes are quite similar to each other, and we don't want to overpenalize predicting similar classes such as kangaroo and wallaby. As suggested by the reviewer, this metric also enables comparison between the in-domain, out-domain, and transfer test sets.\n\n> the F1 scores from the separate classifier are from training or test set evaluations\n\nThe plot in Figure 2a and its associated F1 scores are derived from the in-domain test set. \n\n> discarding any image with a category beyond the 398-th most frequent one\n\nWhen we build our dataset, we discard images that are not likely to be an animal, as determined by a pre-trained classifier.\n\n> numbering all display style equations\n\nWe appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to add equation numbers, but believe that since we have so many equations, it is alright to only number the equations that we reference explicitly in the text. \n\n> when describing the recurrent receiver, explain the case where it terminates (s^t=1) first such that P(o_r=1) is defined prior to being used in the message generation equation\n\nThe first message of the receiver is learned as a separate parameter in all cases and we’ve mentioned this in the “Recurrent Receiver” portion of Section 3.\n\n> the analysis is Figure 3 b,c\n\nFor Figure 3b and 3c, we show only the top-4 predicted classes because the probabilities given to the other classes are negligible in comparison. The observation that we made regarding this figure (that as the conversation progresses, similar but incorrect categories receive smaller probabilities than the correct one) held for all other categories, but we limited to these two classes as we felt this sufficiently conveyed the idea.\n\n> I encourage authors to see the EMNLP 2017 paper \"Natural Language Does Not Emerge ‘Naturally’ in Multi-Agent Dialog\" which also perform multi-round dialogs between two agents. Like this work, the authors also proposed removing memory from one of the agents as a means to avoid learning degenerate 'non-dialog' protocols.\n\nAnd\n\n> Very minor point: the use of fixed-length, non-sequence style utterances is somewhat disappointing given the other steps made in the paper to make the reference game more 'human like' such as early termination, shared vocabularies, and unconstrained utterance types. I understand however that this is left as future work.\n\nThere are some matters that we will leave for future work. Kottur et al. explain how limiting memory can force consistency over different steps in a dialog. This can be a useful property, but our work was primarily concerned with the distribution over messages and the model’s prediction confidence. It’s a natural progression to investigate the meaning of these messages as a follow-up work, and to attempt models that encode meaning not only in individual words, but also the latent structure in sequences of words.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Emergent Communication in a Multi-Modal, Multi-Step Referential Game","abstract":"Inspired by previous work on emergent communication in referential games, we propose a novel multi-modal, multi-step referential game, where the sender and receiver have access to distinct modalities of an object, and their information exchange is bidirectional and of arbitrary duration.

The multi-modal reference game provides an interesting setting for communication, with agents learning to map descriptions to images. The receiving agent's direct control over dialog length is also novel and allows for the interesting analysis presented in later sections. \n\nOverall I think this is an interesting and well-designed work; however, some details are missing that I think would make for a stronger submission (see weaknesses).\n\n\n--------------\nStrengths:\n--------------\n- Generally well-written with the Results and Analysis section appearing especially thought-out and nicely presented.\n\n- The proposed reference game provides a number of novel contributions -- giving the agents control over dialog length, providing both agents with the same vocabulary without constraints on how each uses it (implicit through pretraining or explicit in the structure/loss), and introducing an asymmetric multi-modal context for the dialog.\n\n- The analysis is extensive and well-grounded in the three key hypothesis presented at the beginning of Section 6.\n\n--------------\nWeaknesses:\n--------------\n\n- There is room to improve the clarity of Sections 3 and 4 and I encourage the authors to revisit these sections. Some specific suggestions that might help:\n\t\t- numbering all display style equations\n\t\t- when describing the recurrent receiver, explain the case where it terminates (s^t=1) first such that P(o_r=1) is defined prior to being used in the message generation equation. \n\n- I did not see an argument in support of the accuracy@K metric. Why is putting the ground truth in the top 10% the appropriate metric in this setting? Is it to enable comparison between the in-domain, out-domain, and transfer settings?\n\n- Unless I missed something, the transfer test set results only comes up once in the context of attention methods and are not mentioned elsewhere. Why is this? It seems appropriate to include in Figure 5 if no where else in the analysis.\n\n- Do the authors have a sense for how sensitive these results are to different runs of the training process?\n\n- I did not understand this line from Section 5.1: \"and discarding any image with a category beyond the 398-th most frequent one, as classified by a pretrained ImageNet classifier'\"\n\n- It is not specified (or I missed it) whether the F1 scores from the separate classifier are from training or test set evaluations.\n\n- I would have liked to see analysis on the training process such as a plot of reward (or baseline adjusted reward) over training iterations. \n\n- I encourage authors to see the EMNLP 2017 paper \"Natural Language Does Not Emerge ‘Naturally’ in Multi-Agent Dialog\" which also perform multi-round dialogs between two agents. Like this work, the authors also proposed removing memory from one of the agents as a means to avoid learning degenerate 'non-dialog' protocols.\n\n- Very minor point: the use of fixed-length, non-sequence style utterances is somewhat disappointing given the other steps made in the paper to make the reference game more 'human like' such as early termination, shared vocabularies, and unconstrained utterance types. I understand however that this is left as future work.\n\n\n--------------\nCuriosities:\n--------------\n- I think the analysis is Figure 3 b,c is interesting and wonder if something similar can be computed over all examples. One option would be to plot accuracy@k for different utterance indexes -- essentially forcing the model to make a prediction after each round of dialog (or simply repeating its prediction if the model has chosen to stop). \n\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Emergent Communication in a Multi-Modal, Multi-Step Referential Game","abstract":"Inspired by previous work on emergent communication in referential games, we propose a novel multi-modal, multi-step referential game, where the sender and receiver have access to distinct modalities of an object, and their information exchange is bidirectional and of arbitrary duration.
