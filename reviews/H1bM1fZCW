You're absolutely right - GradNorm at an implementation level amounts to dynamically finding the right weights w_i(t) which then goes into a weighted average of each individual task loss. This is implemented via the equations in the manuscript. However, the core reason these equations are meaningful is because they set a common scale for our backpropped gradients by *normalizing* gradients to two additional pieces of data: (1) the average gradient norms amongst different tasks, and (2) the relative training rate of tasks. The influence of the latter is controlled by the asymmetry parameter alpha, as described in the manuscript. That's why we are normalizing our gradients: we discovered a meaningful common scale for these gradients which tells us how they relate to each other and we use these relationships to our advantage during training.\n\nThanks also for pointing out the other paper - I think it would be more well-defined to just refer to our method as GradNorm, which we also used to draw the analogy to BatchNorm. Normalizing gradients can mean many different things (depending on the objective, the scale/data you normalize to, etc.), and our proposed method focuses on one way to do this in the context of multitask learning. But depending on the application there can certainly be other methods where the term \"gradient normalization\" would also apply. \n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"GradNorm: Gradient Normalization for Adaptive Loss Balancing in Deep Multitask Networks","abstract":"Deep multitask networks, in which one neural network produces multiple predictive outputs, are more scalable and often better regularized than their single-task counterparts.

This work proposes a dynamic weight update scheme that updates weights for different task losses during training time by making use of the loss ratios of different tasks. Experiments on two different network indicate that the proposed scheme is better than using hand-tuned weights for multi-task neural networks.\n\n\nPaper Strengths:\n- The proposed technique seems simple yet effective for multi-task learning.\n- Experiments on two different network architectures showcasing the generality of the proposed method.\n\n\nMajor Weaknesses:\n- The main weakness of this work is the unclear exposition of the proposed technique. Entire technique is explained in a short section-3.1 with many important details missing. There is no clear basis for the main equations 1 and 2. How does equation-2 follow from equation-1? Where is the expectation coming from? What exactly does ‘F’ refer to? There is dependency of ‘F’ on only one of sides in equations 1 and 2? More importantly, how does the gradient normalization relate to loss weight update? It is very difficult to decipher these details from the short descriptions given in the paper.\n- Also, several details are missing in toy experiments. What is the task here? What are input and output distributions and what is the relation between input and output? Are they just random noises? If so, is the network learning to overfit to the data as there is no relationship between input and output? \n\n\nMinor Weaknesses:\n- There are no training time comparisons between the proposed technique and the standard fixed loss learning.\n- Authors claim that they operate directly on the gradients inside the network. But, as far as I understood, the authors only update loss weights in this paper. Did authors also experiment with gradient normalization in the intermediate CNN layers?\n- No comparison with state-of-the-art techniques on the experimented tasks and datasets.\n\n\nClarifications:\n- See the above mentioned issues with the exposition of the technique.\n- In the experiments, why are the input images downsampled to 320x320?\n- What does it mean by ‘unofficial dataset’ (page-4). Any references here?\n- Why is 'task normalized' test-time loss as good measure for comparison between models in the toy example (Section 4)? The loss ratios depend on initial loss, which is not important for the final performance of the system.\n\n\nSuggestions:\n- I strongly suggest the authors to clearly explain the proposed technique to get this into a publishable state. \n- The term ’GradNorm’ seem to be not defined anywhere in the paper.\n\n\nReview Summary:\nDespite promising results, the proposed technique is quite unclear from the paper. With its poor exposition of the technique, it is difficult to recommend this paper for publication.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"GradNorm: Gradient Normalization for Adaptive Loss Balancing in Deep Multitask Networks","abstract":"Deep multitask networks, in which one neural network produces multiple predictive outputs, are more scalable and often better regularized than their single-task counterparts.

The key idea is to enforce the gradients from multi tasks balanced so that no tasks are ignored in the training. The authors also demonstrated that the technique can improve test errors over single task learning and uncertainty weighting on a large real-world dataset.\n\nIt is an interesting paper with a novel approach to multi-task learning. To improve the paper, it would be helpful to evaluate the method under various settings. My detailed comments are below.\n\n1. Multi-task learning can have various settings. For example, we may have multiple groups of tasks, where tasks are correlated within groups but tasks in different groups are not much correlated. Also, tasks may have hierarchical correlation structures. These patterns often appear in biological datasets. I am wondering how a variety of multi-task settings can be handled by the proposed approach. It would be helpful to discuss the conditions where we can benefit from the proposed method.\n\n2. One intuitive approach to task balancing would be to weight each task objective based on the variance of each task.  It would be helpful to add a few simple and intuitive baselines in the experiments. \n\n3. In Section 4, it would be great to have more in-depth simulations (e.g., multi-task learning in various settings). Also, in the bottom right panel in Figure 2, GrandNorm and equal weighting decrease test errors effectively even after 15000 steps but uncertainty weighting seems to reach a plateau. Discussions on this would be useful.\n\n4. It would be useful to discuss the implementation of the method as well. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","confidence":"2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"GradNorm: Gradient Normalization for Adaptive Loss Balancing in Deep Multitask Networks","abstract":"Deep multitask networks, in which one neural network produces multiple predictive outputs, are more scalable and often better regularized than their single-task counterparts.
