The experimental section is strong and it has evaluated across different datasets and various scenarios.

Could the authors confirm that the reported CERS are on validation/test dataset and not on train/dev data? It is not explicitly stated. I hope it is indeed the former, else I have a major concern with the efficacy of the algorithm as ultimately, we care about the test performance of the compressed models in comparison to uncompressed model. \n\n2. In B.1 the authors use an increasing number units in the hidden layers of the GRUs as opposed to a fixed size like in Deep Speech 2, an obvious baseline that is missing from the  experiments is the comparison with *exact* same GRU (with  768, 1024, 1280, 1536 hidden units) *without any compression*. \n\n3.  What do different points in Fig 3 and 4 represent. What are the values of lamdas that were used to train (the l2 and trace norm regularization) the Stage 1 of models shown in Fig 4. I want to understand what is the difference in the  two types of  behavior of orange points (some of them seem to have good compression while other do not - it she difference arising from initialization or different choice of lambdas in stage 1. \n\nIt is interesting that altho L2 regularization does not lead to low \\nu parameters in Stage 1, the compression stage does have comparable performance to that of trace norm minimization. The authors point it out, but a further investigation might be interesting. \n\nWriting:\n1. The GRU model for which the algorithm is proposed is not introduced until the appendix. While it is a standard network, I think the details should still be included in the main text to understand some of the notation referenced in the text like “\\lambda_rec” and “\\lambda_norec”","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Trace norm regularization and faster inference for embedded speech recognition RNNs","abstract":"We propose and evaluate new techniques for compressing and speeding up dense matrix multiplications as found in the fully connected and recurrent layers of neural networks for embedded large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR).

The technique consists of first training a model by constraining its trace norm, which allows it to be well-approximated by a truncated SVD in a second fine-tuning stage. Overall, I think this is interesting work, but I have a few concerns which I’ve listed below:\n\n1. Section 4, which describes the experiments of compressing server sized acoustic models for embedded recognition seems a bit “disjoint” from the rest of the paper. I had a number of clarification questions spefically on this section:\n- Am I correct that the results in this section do not use the trace-norm regularization at all? It would strengthen the paper significantly if the experiments presented on WSJ in the first section were also conducted on the “internal” task with more data.\n- How large are the training/test sets used in these experiments (for test sets, number of words, for training sets, amount of data in hours (is this ~10,000hrs), whether any data augmentation such as multi-style training was done, etc.)\n- What are the “tier-1” and “tier-2” models in this section? It would also aid readability if the various models were described more clearly in this section, with an emphasis on structure, output targets, what LMs are used, how are the LMs pruned for the embedded-size models, etc. Also, particularly given that the focus is on embedded speech recognition, of which the acoustic model is one part, I would like a few more details on how decoding was done, etc.\n- The details in appendix B are interesting, and I think they should really be a part of the main paper. That being said, the results in Section B.5, as the authors mention, are somewhat preliminary, and I think the paper would be much stronger if the authors can re-run these experiments were models are trained to convergence.\n- The paper focuses fairly heavily on speech recognition tasks, and I wonder if it would be more suited to a conference on speech recognition. \n\n2. Could the authors comment on the relative training time of the models with the trace-norm regularizer, L2-regularizer and the unconstrained model in terms of convergence time.\n\n3. Clarification question: For the WSJ experiments was the model decoded without an LM? If no LM was used, then the choice of reporting results in terms of only CER is reasonable, but I think it would be good to also report WERs on the WSJ set in either case.\n\n4. Could the authors indicate the range of values of \\lambda_{rec} and \\lambda_{nonrec} that were examined in the work? Also, on a related note, in Figure 2, does each point correspond to a specific choice of these regularization parameters?\n\n5. Figure 4: For the models in Figure 4, it would be useful to indicate the starting CER of the stage-1 model before stage-2 training to get a sense of how stage-2 training impacts performance.\n\n6. Although the results on the WSJ set are interesting, I would be curious if the same trends and conclusions can be drawn from a larger dataset -- e.g., the internal dataset that results are reported on later in the paper, or on a set like Switchboard. I think these experiments would strengthen the paper.\n\n7. The experiments in Section 3.2.3 were interesting, since they demonstrate that the model can be warm-started from a model that hasn’t fully converged. Could the authors also indicate the CER of the model used for initialization in addition to the final CER after stage-2 training in Figure 5.\n\n8. In Section 4, the authors mention that quantization could be used to compress models further although this is usually degrades WER by 2--4% relative. I think the authors should consider citing previous works which have examined quantization for embedded speech recognition [1], [2]. In particular, note that [2] describes a technique for training with quantized forward passes which results in models that have smaller performance degradation relative to quantization after training.\nReferences:\n[1] Vincent Vanhoucke, Andrew Senior, and Mark Mao, “Improving the speed of neural networks on cpus,” in Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning Workshop, NIPS, 2011.\n[2] Raziel Alvarez, Rohit Prabhavalkar, Anton Bakhtin, “On the efficient representation and execution of deep acoustic models,” Proc. of Interspeech, pp. 2746 -- 2750, 2016.\n\n9. Minor comment: The authors use the term “warmstarting” to refer to the process of training NNs by initializing from a previous model. It would be good to clarify this in the text.","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Trace norm regularization and faster inference for embedded speech recognition RNNs","abstract":"We propose and evaluate new techniques for compressing and speeding up dense matrix multiplications as found in the fully connected and recurrent layers of neural networks for embedded large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR).
