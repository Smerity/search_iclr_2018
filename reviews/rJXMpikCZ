These embeddings can be used in downstream tasks the most common of which is node classification.\n\nSeveral existing approaches have been proposed in recent years. The authors provide a fair and almost comprehensive  discussion of state of the art approaches. There are a couple of exception that have already been mentioned in a comment from Thomas Kipf and Michael Bronstein. A more precise discussion of the differences between existing approaches (especially MoNets) should be a crucial addition to the paper. You provide such a  comparison in your answer to Michael's comment. To me, the comparison makes sense but it also shows that the ideas presented here are less novel than they might initially seem. The proposed method introduces two forms of (simple) attention. Nothing groundbreaking here but still interesting enough and well explained. It might also be a good idea to compare your method to something like LLE (locally linear embedding). LLE also learns a weight for each of neighbors of a node and computes the embedding as a weighted average of the neighbor embeddings according to these weights. Your approach is different since it is learned end-to-end (not in two separate steps) and because it is applicable to arbitrary graphs (not just graphs where every node has exactly k neighbors as in LLE). Still, something to relate to. \n\nPlease take a look at the comment by Fabian Jansen. I think he is on to something. It seems that the attention weight (from i to j) in the end is only a normalization operation that doesn't take the embedding of node i into account.  \n\nThere are two  issues with the experiments.\n\nFirst, you don't report results on Pubmed because your method didn't scale. Considering that Pubmed has less than 20,000 nodes this shows a clear weakness of your approach. You write (in an answer to a comment) that it *should* be parallelizable but somehow you didn't make it work. We have to, however, evaluate the approach on what it is able to do at the moment. Having a complexity that is quadratic in the number of nodes is terrible and one of the major reasons learning with graphs has moved from kernels to neural approaches. While it is great that you acknowledge this openly as a weakness, it is currently not possible to claim that your method scales to even moderately sized graphs. \n\nSecond, the experimental set-up on the Cora and Citeseer data sets should be properly randomized. As Thomas pointed out, for graph data the variance can be quite high. For some split the method might perform really well and less well for others. In your answer titled \"Requested clarifications\" to a different comment you provide numbers randomized over 10 runs. Did you randomize the parameter initialization only or also the the train/val/test splits? If you did the latter, this seems reasonable. In Kipf et al.'s GCN paper this is what was done (not over 100 splits as some other commenter claimed. The average over 100 runs  pertained to the ICA method only.)

I want to thank\nthe author for actively participating in the discussions and in clarifying already\nmany of the details that I was missing.\n\nAs also reported in the comments by T. Kipf I found the lack of comparison to previous\nworks on attention and on constructions of NN for graph data are missing.\nIn particular MoNet seems a more general framework, using features to compute node\nsimilarity is another way to specify the \"coordinate system\" for convolution.\nI would argue that in many cases the graph is given and that one would have\nto exploit its structure rather than the simple first order neighbors structure.\n\nI feel, in fact, that the paper deals mainly with \"localized metric-learning\" rather than\nusing the information in the graph itself. There is no\nexplicit usage of the graph beyond the selection of the local neighborhood.\nIn many ways when I first read it I though it would be a modified version of\nmemory networks (which have not been cited).

Accordingly, results after 100 runs of our model largely follow the trend of the 10-run result:\nCora: 83.0 +- 0.7 (maximum 84.3%)\nCiteseer: 72.6 +- 0.8 (maximum 74.2%)\n\nTo highlight: we have used a 1-run result (without any additional runs), rather than the best result, in the original writeup as submitted. Our N-run results already showed it is possible to achieve better single-run results than 83.3% and 74.0%, respectively. \n\nOur particular choice of attentional mechanism, a, is explicitly written out in Equation (3), clarified by the text immediately preceding this Equation, and illustrated by Figure 1 (left). It may be expressed as:\n\na(x, y) = a^T[x||y]\nwhere a is a learnable weight vector, || is concatenation, and ^T is transposition.\n\nThat is, it corresponds to a simple, linear, single-layer MLP with a single output neuron,  acting on the concatenated features of the two nodes to compute the attention coefficient---largely similar to the original attention mechanism of Bahdanau et al.\n\nTheoretically, our model needs to compute the attentional coefficients e_{i, j} only across the edges of the graph, i.e. O(|E|) computations of a single-layer MLP overall, which are independent, and thus can be parallelised. This is on par with other baseline techniques (such as GCNs or Chebyshev Nets). Taking into account that we need to perform a matrix multiplication on each node's features (to transform the feature space from F to F' features), we may express the overall computational complexity of a single attention head's computations as O(|V| x F x F' + |E| x F'), where F is the input feature count, and F' the output feature count---keeping in mind that many of these computations are trivially parallelisable on a GPU.\n\nThe P(N, 2) or C(N, 2) values mentioned in your comment would correspond to a dense graph (E ~ V^2), where O(V^2) complexity is unavoidable regardless of which graph technique is selected.\n\nUnfortunately, even though the softmax computation on every node should be trivially parallelisable, we were unable to make advantage of our tensor manipulation framework to achieve this parallelisation, while retaining a favourable storage complexity (as its softmax function is optimised for same-sized vectors). This implied that we had to reuse the technique from the self-attention paper of Vaswani et al., wherein attention is computed over all pairs of nodes, with a bias value of -inf inserted into non-connected pairs of nodes. This required a storage complexity of O(V^2), and caused OOM errors on our GPU when the Pubmed dataset was provided---which is the reason for the lack of results on Pubmed. \n\nWe were, however, able to run our model on the PPI dataset, which has 3x the number of nodes and 18x the number of edges of Pubmed. We were able to do this as PPI is split into 24 disjoint graphs (with test graphs entirely unseen), allowing us to effectively batch the softmax operation. This should still demonstrate evidence of the fact our model is capable of retaining competitive performance when scaling up to larger graphs (and, perhaps more critically, that it is capable of inductive, as well as transductive, generalisation).\n\nWe thank you once again for your comments, and will be sure to include some  aspects of the above discussion in a revised version of the paper!"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Graph Attention Networks","abstract":"We present graph attention networks (GATs), novel neural network architectures that operate on graph-structured data, leveraging masked self-attentional layers to address the shortcomings of prior methods based on graph convolutions or their approximations.

However, we have now performed further experiments on the baseline techniques, in line with some of your recommendations, and the results of this study still point to an outperformance by GAT models. We focused on the experiments that were easily runnable without significantly modifying the codebases at https://github.com/tkipf/gcn and https://github.com/williamleif/GraphSAGE. Our findings can be summarised as follows, and will be highlighted in an updated version of the paper:\n\nCora/Citeseer: We have trained the GCN and Chebyshev (K = 2 and K = 3) models, with a hidden size of 64, with ReLU and ELU activations, for 10 runs each. Note that we did not need to add an additional input linear layer (as suggested by the comment), given that the code at https://github.com/tkipf/gcn/blob/master/gcn/layers.py#L176 already does this.\n\nThe best-performing models achieved the following mean +- std results:\n\nCora: 81.5 +- 0.7 (Cheby2 ReLU)\nCiteseer: 71.0 +- 0.3 (Cheby3 ELU and GCN ReLU)\n\nThese results are still outperformed by both our model's single-run performance (as in our paper) and 10-run performance (as in our reply to a previous comment below).\n\nPPI: Firstly, we would like to note that our model actually considers three-hop neighbourhoods (rather than four), and that the GraphSAGE models feature skip connections---in fact, our model only has one skip connection in total whereas GraphSAGE has a skip connection for every aggregation layer (the concat operation in Line 5 of Algorithm 1 in https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02216). The authors of GraphSAGE have, in fact, highlighted that this skip connection was critical to their performance gains.\n\nIn line with this, we have tested a wide range of larger GraphSAGE models with three aggregation layers, with both ReLU and ELU activations, spanning feature counts up to 1024. Specially, for the third layer we focused on feature counts of 121 and 726, as our GAT model’s final aggregation layer also acts as a classification layer, computing 6 * 121 features which are then pointwise-averaged. Some of these combinations resulted in OOM errors, with the best performing one being a GraphSAGE-LSTM model computing [512, 512, 726] features, with 128 features being used for aggregating neighbourhoods, using the ELU activation. This approach achieved a micro-F1 score of 0.648 on PPI. We have found it beneficial to let the model train for more epochs compared to the original authors' work, and were able to reach a maximal test micro-F1 score of 0.768 after doing so.\n\nThis is still outperformed by a significant margin by both our single-model result (reported in the paper) and our 10-run result (reported in a reply to a previous comment below).\n\nFinally, as pointed out by the comment, we report that, for a pre-trained GAT model on Cora, the mean attentional coefficients in the hidden layer (across all eight attention heads) are 0.275 for the self-edge and 0.185 for the neighbourhood edges."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Graph Attention Networks","abstract":"We present graph attention networks (GATs), novel neural network architectures that operate on graph-structured data, leveraging masked self-attentional layers to address the shortcomings of prior methods based on graph convolutions or their approximations.

Though the authors have used the same split, it is not sufficient to compare them on the original reported results from the baseline papers to indicate that the attention mechanism alone is providing improved results without analysing the \ndifferences in architecture and experiment results. The proposed model besides the proposed attention mechanism has additional learning capacity as the model introduces an additional linear layer for input projection and has more number of hidden units per layer. Kipf's GCN has reported results with hidden units set to 16 whereas the size of the attention feature size (8*8) is 64. It is not clear how much improvement does the increased hidden size provides. It would be clear if the authors report results for the GCN and Chebyshev model with and additional input linear layer and hidden size set to 64. And also report the effect of use of elu activation functions instead of RELU as previously mentioned by Thomas Kipf in his comment.\n\nSimilarly in the inductive learning task the attention feature size is 1024 whereas the max feature size for the GraphSage models are 256. The GraphSage results are reported with partial neighborhood information from 2 hop neighbors. Whereas, in this paper the authors have used skip connections (also used in GCN) and the complete neighborhood information from 4-hop neighbors. No analysis of the effect of these two components are mentioned. It is not clear how the proposed model would perform under the same setting as in GraphSage (2-hop and partial neighborhood) or how much improvement would GraphSage obtain with skip connections and 4-hop information. On a side note, as GraphSage is not efficient to work with complete neighborhood, the authors can use Kipf's implementation of GCN and Chebyshev to report results on PPI with 4-hop complete neighborhood information and skip-connection. With these additional experiments, it would be clear how much improvement does the proposed attention mechanism exactly provides.\n\nFurther, I'm surprised that attention mechanism can provide improved results especially with Cora and Citeseer where the average degree is less than 2. These two datasets are highly homophilous. It would be useful if the authors report the mean attention score for the self edge and its neighbors.\n"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Graph Attention Networks","abstract":"We present graph attention networks (GATs), novel neural network architectures that operate on graph-structured data, leveraging masked self-attentional layers to address the shortcomings of prior methods based on graph convolutions or their approximations.

MoNets are definitely a highly relevant piece of related work to ours, and therefore they will receive appropriate treatment and a citation in the subsequent revision of our paper.\n\nWe find that our work can indeed be reformulated as a particular case of the MoNet framework. Namely, setting the pseudo-coordinate function to be \n\nu(x, y) = f(x) || f(y)\n(where f(x) represent (potentially MLP-transformed) features of node x, and || is concatenation) \n\nand the weight function to be \n\nw_j(u) = softmax(MLP(u))\n(with the softmax performed over the entire neighbourhood of a node)\n\nwould make the patch operator similar to ours. \n\nThis could be interpreted as a way of integrating the ideas of self-attentional interfaces (such as the work of Vaswani et al.: https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762 ) into the patch-operator framework presented by MoNet. Specially, and in comparison to the previously specified MoNet frameworks, our model uses node features for similarity computations, rather than the node's structural properties (such as their degrees in the graph). This, in combination with using a multilayer perceptron for computing the attention coefficients, allows the network more freedom in the way it chooses to express similarities between different nodes in the graph, irrespective of the local topological properties. The addition of the softmax function ensures that these coefficients will be well-behaved (and potentially probabilistically interpretable).\n\nLastly, our work also features a few stabilising additions to the attention model (to better cope with the smaller training set sizes), such as applying dropout on the computed attention coefficients, exposing the network to a stochastically sampled neighbourhood on every iteration. Such regularisation techniques might be harder to interpret or justify when structural properties are used as pseudo-coordinates, as stochastically dropping neighbours changes e.g. the node degrees.\n\nTo avoid any potential confusion for other readers of this discussion, we would like to also highlight that the arXiv link for MoNets that we referred to is: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.08402.pdf "},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Graph Attention Networks","abstract":"We present graph attention networks (GATs), novel neural network architectures that operate on graph-structured data, leveraging masked self-attentional layers to address the shortcomings of prior methods based on graph convolutions or their approximations.
