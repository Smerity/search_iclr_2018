(2017), which performs SGD with adaptive batch sizes. The present paper generalizes the algorithm to SGD with momentum. Since the original algorithm was already formulated with a general utility function, the proposed algorithm is similar in structure but replaces the utility function so that it takes momentum into account. Experiments on an image classification task show improvements in the training loss. However, no test accuracies are reported and the learning curves have suspicious artifacts, see below. Experiments on a relation extraction task show little improvement over SGD with momentum and constant batch size.\n\n\nCOMMENTS:\n\nThe paper discusses a relevant issue. While adaptive learning algorithms are popular in deep learning, most algorithms adapt the learning rate or the momentum coefficient, but not the batch size. It appears to me that the main idea and the overall structure of the proposed algorithm is the same as in the one published by Yin et al. (2017), and that only few changes were necessary to include momentum. Given the incremental process, I find the presentation unnecessarily involved, and experiments not convincing enough.\n\nConcerning the presentation, the paper dedicates two full pages on a review of the algorithm by Yin et al. (2017). The first page of this review states that, for large enough batch sizes, the change of the objective function in SGD is normal distributed with a variance that is inversely proportional the batch size. It seems to me that this is a direct consequence of the central limit theorem. The derivation, however, is quite technical and introduces some quantities that are never used (e.g., $\\vec{\\xi}_j$ is never used individually, only the combined term $\\epsilon_t$ defined below Eq. 12 is). The second page of the review seems to discuss the main part of the algorithm, but I could not follow it. First, a \"state\" $s_t$ (also written as $S$) is introduced, which, according to the text, is \"the objective value\", which was earlier denoted by $F$. Nevertheless, the change of $s_t$, Eq. 5, appears to obey a different probability distribution than the change of $F$. The paper provides a verbal explanation for this discrepancy, saying that it is possible that $S$ is first reduced to the minimum $S^*$ of the objective and then increased again. However, in my understanding, the minimum of the objective is only realized at a singular point in parameter space. Crossing this point in an update step should have zero probability as long as the model has more than one parameter. The explanation also does not make it clear why the argument should apply to $S$ (or $s$) but not to $F$.\n\nPage 5 provides pseudocode for the proposed algorithm. However, I couldn't find an explanation of the code. The code suggests that, for each update step, one gradually increases the batch size until it becomes larger or equal than a running estimate of the optimal batch size. While this may be a plausible strategy in practice, it seems to have a bias that is not addressed in the paper: the algorithm recalculates a noisy estimate of the optimal batch size after each increase of the batch size, and it terminates as soon as the noisy estimate happens to be small enough, resulting in a bias towards a smaller than optimal batch size. A probably more important issue is that the algorithm is sequential and hard to parallelize, where parallelization is usually the main motivation to use larger batch sizes. As the gradient noise scales inversely proportional to the batch size, I don't see why increasing the batch size should be preferred over decreasing the learning rate unless optimizations with a larger batch size can be parallelized. The experiments don't compare the two alternatives.\n\nConcerning the experiments, it seems peculiar that the learning curves in Figure 1 remain at a constant value for a long time at the beginning of the optimization before they begin to drop. Do the authors understand this behavior? It could indicate that the magnitude of the random initialization was chosen too small. I.e., the parameters might have been initialized too close to zero, where the loss is stationary due to symmetries. Also, absolute values of the training loss can be deceptive since there is often no natural scale. A better indicator of convergence would be the test accuracy. The identification of the \"batch size boom\" is interesting.","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"On Batch Adaptive Training for Deep Learning: Lower Loss and Larger Step Size","abstract":"Mini-batch gradient descent and its variants are commonly used in deep learning.

KDD paper, and think the experiments must include results on testing data.","rating":"5: Marginally below acceptance threshold","review":"The authors propose extending the recently-proposed adaptive batch-size approach of Yin et al. to an update that includes momentum, and perform more comprehensive experiments than in the Yin et al. paper validating their approach.\n\nThe basic idea makes a great deal of intuitive sense: inaccurate gradient estimates are fine in early iterations, when we're far from convergence, and accurate estimates are more valuable in later iterations, when we're close. Finding the optimal trade-off between computational cost and expected decrease seems like the most natural way to accomplish this, and this is precisely what they propose. That said, I'm not totally convinced by the derivation of sections 2 and 3: the Gaussian assumption is fine as a heuristic (and they don't really claim that it's anything else), but I don't feel that the proposed algorithm really rests on a solid theoretical foundation.\n\nThe extension to the momentum case (section 3) seems to be more-or-less straightforward, but I do have a question about equation 15: am I misreading this, or is it saying that the variance of the momentum update \\mathcal{P} is the same as the variance of the most recent minibatch? Shouldn't it depend on the previous terms which are included in \\mathcal{P}?\n\nI'm also not convinced by the dependence on the \"optimal\" objective function value S^* in equation 6. In their algorithm, they take S^* to be zero, which is a good conservative choice for a nonnegative loss, but the fact that this quantity is present in the first place, as a user-specified parameter, makes me nervous, since even for a nonnegative loss, the optimum might be quite far from zero, and on a non-convex problem, the eventual local optimum at which we eventually settle down may be further still.\n\nAlso, the \"Robbins 2007\" reference should, I believe, be \"Robbins and Monro, 1951\".\n\nThese are all relatively minor issues, however. My main criticism is that the experiments only report results in terms of *training* loss. The use of adaptive batch sizes does indeed appear to result in faster convergence in terms of training loss, but the plots are in log scale (which I do think is the right way to present it), so the difference is smaller in reality than it appears visually. To determine whether this improvement in training performance is a *real* improvement, I think we need to see the performance (in terms of accuracy, not loss) on held-out data.\n\nFinally, as the authors mention in the final paragraph of their conclusion, some recent work has indicated that large-batch methods may generalize worse than small-batch methods. They claim that, by using small batches early and large batches late, they may avoid this issue, and I don't necessarily disagree, but I think an argument could be made in the opposite direction: that since the proposed approach becomes a large-batch method in the later iterations, it may suffer from this problem. I think that this is worth exploring further, and, again, without results on testing data being presented, a reader can't make any determination about how well the proposed method generalizes, compared to fixed-size minibatches.\n","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"On Batch Adaptive Training for Deep Learning: Lower Loss and Larger Step Size","abstract":"Mini-batch gradient descent and its variants are commonly used in deep learning.
