We dont know the reason for this accuracy discrepancy and are debugging our implementation; because of this accuracy discrepancy we did not report WRPN results on MobileNet.\n\nNevertheless,  this model with 2-bits weight and 4-bits activation gives Top-1 accuracy of 54.24% (i.e. a loss of 10.6%). With 2-bits weight and 4-bits activation and making the model 2x-wider, we get 64.66% Top-1 accuracy (a loss of 0.21% from our baseline). This also required the first layer to be widened. We think increasing by 2.1x or so should completely recover the accuracy.\nSo, we think WRPN works for smaller networks.\n\nHowever, the more compact the model the harder it is to quantize to very low precision -- i.e. the accuracy loss is big with quantization to ternary or 4-bits precision. One interesting study we found is https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.01878.pdf which shows a large sparse model is better than a small compact model. In the same theme, we believe a (somewhat) large quantized model is better than a small full-precision model.

So the effect on overall compute is smaller for these layers if not negligible. In our work, the first layer and last layer's weights and activations are not quantized and neither are these layers' width increased.\n\nFor the first and last layer, we find, we can quantize the weights to 8-bits (at most) without much loss in accuracy compared to keeping them at full-precision (~0.2% additional accuracy loss) while quantizing the other layers to 4bits activations and 2-bits weight. So, in theory we can use integer compute for these layers if not 2-bits and 4-bits precision to speed up compute.\n\nThe primary reason we did not quantize the first and last layer is because - we wanted to fairly compare against prior proposals - the works we compared against in the paper do not quantize these layers.\n\nAt what widening factor does 1-bit come at-par with baseline full-precision?\nOur very preliminary results tell us that this could probably happen at 3.5x-4x widening. \nWe run into experimental evaluation issues when doing these experiments -- making the layers wider blows up the device memory requirements (since we \"emulate\" the binary and other low-precision knobs with FP32 precision in GPUs).

We defend the novelty aspect of this paper in our response below.\n\nNovelty:\nOur paper targets quantization at no accuracy loss. We target network training on reduced precision hardware (H/W) considering a system-wide approach - system and on-chip memory footprint of activations is much more than weights.\nFor cloud-based inference deployments (where large batch-size is typical) and during training, reducing precision of activations speeds up end-to-end runtime much more than reducing the precision of weights (Fig. 1). \nHowever, as our paper shows, reducing activation precision hurts accuracy much more than reducing weight precision. No prior work targets this aspect.\n\nMost prior works on reduced precision DNNs sacrifice accuracy and many prior works target reducing precision of just the weights. We show that there is no tradeoff in reducing precision - even during training - one can get the same accuracy as baseline by making the networks wider (yes, more raw compute operations, but still the compute cost is lower than baseline).\n\n\n1. We believe lowering precision is one aspect (which is widely studied in literature) but it is important to lower precision without any loss in accuracy - no prior work has shown reduced-precision network (4-bits, 2-bits) training and inference without sacrificing accuracy. \nAlso, our results with binary networks are state-of-the art and close the gap significantly between binary and 32b precision (e.g. less than 1.2% for ResNet-34).\n\n\n2. We believe widening networks is a simple technique (which works) that is easy for programmers to experiment with for recovering accuracy with reduced precision. With WRPN: (a) model-size is smaller and, (b) run time and energy for end-to-end inference as well as training is lower than 32b networks.\n\nWith widening, the number of neurons in a layer increase.

It focuses on an approach to get similar accuracy at lower precision, in addition to cutting down the compute costs. Results with 2-bit activations and 4-bit weights seem to match baseline accuracy across the models listed in the paper.\n\nOriginality\nThis seems to be first paper that consistently matches baseline results below int-8 accuracy, and shows a promising future direction.\n\nSignificance\nGoing down to below 8-bits and potentially all the way down to binary (1-bit weights and activations) is a promising direction for future hardware design. It has the potential to give good results at lower compute and more significantly in providing a lower power option, which is the biggest constraint for higher compute today. \n\nPros:\n- Positive results with low precision (4-bit, 2-bit and even 1-bit)\n- Moving the state of the art in low precision forward\n- Strong potential impact, especially on constrained power environments (but not limited to them)\n- Uses same hyperparameters as original training, making the process of using this much simpler.\n\nCons/Questions\n- They mention not quantizing the first and last layer of every network. How much does that impact the overall compute? \n- Is there a certain width where 1-bit activation and weights would match the accuracy of the baseline model? This could be interesting for low power case, even if the \"effective compute\" is larger than the baseline.\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":1,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"WRPN: Wide Reduced-Precision Networks","abstract":"For computer vision applications, prior works have shown the efficacy of reducing numeric precision of model parameters (network weights) in deep neural networks.

The study is performed on AlexNet, ResNet and Inception on the Imagenet datasets and results show that accuracy matching the full precision baselines can be obtained by widening the filters on the networks. \n\nPositives\n- Using lower precision activations to save memory and compute seems new and widening the filter sizes seems to recover the accuracy lost due to the lower precision.\n\nNegatives\n- While the exhaustive analysis is extremely useful the overall technical contribution of the paper that of widening the networks is fairly small. \n- The paper motivates the need for reduced precision weights from the perspective of saving memory footprint when using large batches. However, the results are more focused on compute cost. Also large batches are used mainly during training where memory is generally not a huge issue. Memory critical situations such as inference on mobile phones can be largely mitigated by using smaller batch sizes. It might help to emphasize the speed-up in compute more in the contributions.
