Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is\nan unsupervised approach that utilizes two ANNs in one system. The first neural\nnetwork is called the Discriminator and evaluates the quality of images generated\nby the other network, the Generator. However, image generation has no fixed\nsolution, making evaluation difficult. This can be addressed through comparing\ntwo GAN models by letting them evaluate each other; the paper proposes a custom\nimplementation of this evaluation method that allows for comparison between two\nGAN models both overall and throughout the learning process.\nGANs have a reputation for being hard to train. One concrete problem is main-\ntaining the balance between the Generator and Discriminator. As for humans, it\nis easier to rate the quality of images then it is to actually create them. A good\nevaluator is necessary, but it must not out-power the generative model. The paper\nexplores two main approaches to achieve a better balanced GAN model. The first\nmethod makes guided alterations to the usually random input of the Generator.\nThe second method adds an additional Discriminator to the model. Techniques\nbased on both of these methods were shown to effectively guide the training pro-\ncess and creating strong models that outperformed regular GANs when compared\nusing the previously mentioned evaluation method.","pdf":"/pdf/b9ca5077f6a0c9481b172ad051d0bff48f2949c2.pdf","paperhash":"gambäck|improving_discriminatorgenerator_balance_in_generative_adversarial_networks","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018improving,          \ntitle={Improving Discriminator-Generator Balance in Generative Adversarial Networks},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1182/Authors"],"keywords":[]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509201842158,"tcdate":1509201842158,"number":507,"cdate":1509201841932,"id":"S152vGzCW","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"S152vGzCW","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Placeholder","abstract":"placeholder","pdf":"/pdf/a3ee124c0cc5f02acc976ae67f563ea632fbe23d.pdf","TL;DR":"placeholder","paperhash":"anonymous|placeholder","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2017placeholder,          \ntitle={Placeholder},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2017}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Paper507/Authors"],"keywords":[]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"OpenReview.net"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509144140989,"tcdate":1509144140755,"number":1174,"cdate":1509144140755,"id":"H1S8UE-Rb","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"H1S8UE-Rb","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Complex- and Real-Valued Neural Network Architectures","abstract":"Complex-value neural networks are not a new concept, however, the use of real-values has often been favoured over complex-values due to difficulties in training and accuracy of results.

Model-based RL algorithms are sample-efficient on the other hand, while learning accurate global models of complex dynamic environments has turned out to be tricky in practice, which leads to the unsatisfactory performance of the learned policies. In this work, we combine the sample-efficiency of model-based algorithms and the accuracy of model-free algorithms. We leverage multi-step neural network based predictive models by embedding real trajectories into imaginary rollouts of the model, and use the imaginary cumulative rewards as control variates for model-free algorithms. In this way, we achieved the strengths of both sides and derived an estimator which is not only sample-efficient, but also unbiased and of very low variance.

While the Bayesian approach to learning provides a solid theoretical framework to handle uncertainty, inference in Bayesian-inspired deep neural networks is difficult. In this paper, we provide a practical approach to Bayesian learning that relies on a regularization technique found in nearly every modern network, batch normalization. We show that training a deep network using batch normalization is equivalent to approximate inference in Bayesian models, and we demonstrate how this finding allows us to make useful estimates of the model uncertainty. Using our approach, it is possible to make meaningful uncertainty estimates using conventional architectures without modifying the network or the training procedure. Our approach is thoroughly validated in a series of empirical experiments on different tasks and using various measures, showing it to outperform baselines on a majority of datasets with strong statistical significance.","pdf":"/pdf/ac74faafa0bba2c7808c4d9991b7b711ee064038.pdf","TL;DR":"We show that training a deep network using batch normalization is equivalent to approximate inference in Bayesian models, and we demonstrate how this finding allows us to make useful estimates of the model uncertainty in conventional networks.","paperhash":"anonymous|bayesian_uncertainty_estimation_for_batch_normalized_deep_networks","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018bayesian,          \ntitle={Bayesian Uncertainty Estimation for Batch Normalized Deep Networks},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1155/Authors"],"keywords":["uncertainty estimation","deep learning","Bayesian learning","batch normalization"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509140251306,"tcdate":1509139674890,"number":1164,"cdate":1509139674890,"id":"HJXyS7bRb","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"HJXyS7bRb","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"A Goal-oriented Neural Conversation Model by Self-Play","abstract":"Building chatbots that can accomplish goals such as booking a flight ticket is an unsolved problem in natural language understanding. Much progress has been made to build conversation models using techniques such as sequence2sequence modeling. One challenge in applying such techniques to building goal-oriented conversation models is that maximum likelihood-based models are not optimized toward accomplishing goals. Recently, many methods have been proposed to address this issue by optimizing a reward that contains task status or outcome. However, adding the reward optimization on the fly usually provides little guidance for language construction and the conversation model soon becomes decoupled from the language model. In this paper, we propose a new setting in goal-oriented dialogue system to tighten the gap between these two aspects by enforcing model level information isolation on individual models between two agents. Language construction now becomes an important part in reward optimization since it is the only way information can be exchanged. We experimented our models using self-play and results showed that our method not only beat the baseline sequence2sequence model in rewards but can also generate human-readable meaningful conversations of comparable quality.

Instead, we propose a method that allows an agent to automatically discover the range of tasks that it is capable of performing in its environment.

The generator network is optimized using adversarial training to produce tasks that are always at the appropriate level of difficulty for the agent.  Our method thus automatically produces a curriculum of tasks for the agent to learn.

This limits the ability of such models to generalize to new combinations or orientations of objects as well as their ability to connect with more structured representations such as natural language, without explicit strong supervision. In this work explore the synergistic effect of using partial natural language scene descriptions to help disentangle the latent entities visible an image. We present a novel neural network architecture called Generative Entity Networks, which jointly generates both the natural language descriptions and the images from a set of latent entities. Our model is based on the variational autoencoder framework and makes use of visual attention to identify and characterise the visual attributes of each entity.

The options framework provides formalism for such abstraction over sequences of decisions.  However most models require that options be given a priori, presumably specified by hand, which is neither efficient, nor scalable. Indeed, it is preferable to learn options directly from interaction with the environment. Despite several efforts, this remains a difficult problem: many approaches require access to a model of the environmental dynamics, and inferred options are often not interpretable, which limits our ability to explain the system behavior for verification or debugging purposes.  In this work we develop a novel policy gradient method for the automatic learning of policies with options.  This algorithm uses inference methods to simultaneously improve all of the options available to an agent, and thus can be employed in an off-policy manner, without observing option labels. Experimental results show that the options learned can be interpreted. Further, we find that the method presented here is more sample efficient than existing methods, leading to faster and more stable learning of policies with options.","pdf":"/pdf/7ff2f7d7dba366ae35b85d4dbac7d2a46c59007e.pdf","TL;DR":"We develop a novel policy gradient method for the automatic learning of policies with options using a differentiable inference step.","paperhash":"anonymous|an_inferencebased_policy_gradient_method_for_learning_options","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018an,          \ntitle={An inference-based policy gradient method for learning options},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1126/Authors"],"keywords":["reinforcement learning","hierarchy","options","inference"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509138940285,"tcdate":1509138917988,"number":1134,"cdate":1509138917988,"id":"SyCyMm-0W","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"SyCyMm-0W","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Generative Entity Networks: Disentangling Entities and Attributes in Visual Scenes using Partial Natural Language Descriptions","abstract":"Generative image models have made significant progress in the last few years, and are now able to generate low-resolution images which sometimes look realistic.

This limits the ability of such models to generalize to new combinations or orientations of objects as well as their ability to connect with more structured representations such as natural language, without explicit strong supervision.\n\nIn this work explore the synergistic effect of using partial natural language scene descriptions to help disentangle the latent entities visible an image.

As a result, machine learning service providers have a surging need for useful, additional training data that benefits training, without giving up all the details about the trained program. At the same time, data owners would like to trade their data for its value, without having to first give away the data itself be- fore receiving compensation. It is difficult for data providers and model providers to agree on a fair price without first revealing the data or the trained model to the other side. Escrow systems only complicate this further, adding an additional layer of trust required of both parties. Currently, data owners and model owners don’t have a fair pricing system that eliminates the need to trust a third party and training the model on the data, which 1) takes a long time to complete, 2) does not guarantee that useful data is paid valuably and that useless data isn’t, without trusting in the third party with both the model and the data. Existing improve- ments to secure the transaction focus heavily on encrypting or approximating the data, such as training on encrypted data, and variants of federated learning. As powerful as the methods appear to be, we show them to be impractical in our use case with real world assumptions for preserving privacy for the data owners when facing black-box models. Thus, a fair pricing scheme that does not rely on secure data encryption and obfuscation is needed before the exchange of data. This pa- per proposes a novel method for fair pricing using data-model efficacy techniques such as influence functions, model extraction, and model compression methods, thus enabling secure data transactions. We successfully show that without running the data through the model, one can approximate the value of the data; that is, if the data turns out redundant, the pricing is minimal, and if the data leads to proper improvement, its value is properly assessed, without placing strong assumptions on the nature of the model. Future work will be focused on establishing a system with stronger transactional security against adversarial attacks that will reveal details about the model or the data to the other party.","pdf":"/pdf/69170f53ffe9f431f2c54cd1a453add292d356cb.pdf","TL;DR":"Facing complex, black-box models, encrypting the data is not as usable as approximating the model and using it to price a potential transaction.","paperhash":"anonymous|dont_encrypt_the_data_just_approximate_the_model_\\_towards_secure_transaction_and_fair_pricing_of_training_data","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018don't,          \ntitle={Don't encrypt the data; just approximate the model \\ Towards Secure Transaction and Fair Pricing of Training Data},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1123/Authors"],"keywords":["Applications","Security in Machine Learning","Fairness and Security","Model Compression"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509138950107,"tcdate":1509138915146,"number":1132,"cdate":1509138915146,"id":"H1Nyf7W0Z","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"H1Nyf7W0Z","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Alpha-divergence bridges maximum likelihood and reinforcement learning in neural sequence generation","abstract":"Neural sequence generation is commonly approached by using maximum- likelihood (ML) estimation or reinforcement learning (RL).

In order to counteract these problems, we propose an objective function for sequence generation using α-divergence, which leads to an ML-RL integrated method that exploits better parts of ML and RL. We demonstrate that the proposed objective function generalizes ML and RL objective functions because it includes both as its special cases (ML corresponds to α → 0 and RL to α → 1).

Previously, the Information Bottleneck (IB) framework (\\cite{Tishby99}) extracts relevant information for a target variable. Here, we propose Parametric Information Bottleneck (PIB) for a neural network by utilizing (only) its model parameters explicitly to approximate the compression and the relevance. We show that, as compared to the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) principle, PIBs : (i) improve the generalization of neural networks in classification tasks, (ii) push the representation of neural networks closer to the optimal information-theoretical representation in a faster manner.

We introduce an end-to-end differentiable model for interpreting questions, which is inspired by formal approaches to semantics. Each span of text is represented by a denotation in a knowledge graph, together with a vector that captures ungrounded aspects of meaning. Learned composition modules recursively combine constituents, culminating in a grounding for the complete sentence which is an answer to the question. For example, to interpret ‘not green’, the model will represent ‘green’ as a set of entities, ‘not’ as a trainable ungrounded vector, and then use this vector to parametrize a composition function to perform a complement operation. For each sentence, we build a parse chart subsuming all possible parses, allowing the model to jointly learn both the composition operators and output structure by gradient descent. We show the model can learn to represent a variety of challenging semantic operators, such as quantifiers, negation, disjunctions and composed relations on a synthetic question answering task. The model also generalizes well to longer sentences than seen in its training data, in contrast to LSTM and RelNet baselines.

One aspect of the field receiving considerable attention is efficiently executing deep models in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile or embedded devices. This paper focuses on this problem, and proposes two new compression methods, which jointly leverage weight quantization and distillation of larger teacher networks into smaller student networks. The first method we propose is called quantized distillation and leverages distillation during the training process, by incorporating distillation loss, expressed with respect to the teacher, into the training of a student network whose weights are quantized to a limited set of levels. The second method,  differentiable quantization, optimizes the location of quantization points through stochastic gradient descent, to better fit the behavior of the teacher model.  We validate both methods through experiments on convolutional and recurrent architectures. We show that quantized shallow students can reach similar accuracy levels to full-precision teacher models, while providing order of magnitude compression, and inference speedup that is linear in the depth reduction. In sum, our results enable DNNs for resource-constrained environments to leverage architecture and accuracy advances developed on more powerful devices.\n","pdf":"/pdf/6a770d7c95ac938be4c78c7d38abb92a01749769.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|model_compression_via_distillation_and_quantization","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018model,          \ntitle={MODEL COMPRESSION VIA DISTILLATION AND QUANTIZATION},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1106/Authors"],"keywords":[]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509138599175,"tcdate":1509138556507,"number":1112,"cdate":1509138556507,"id":"Bkftl7ZCW","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"Bkftl7ZCW","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"DON’T ENCRYPT THE DATA, JUST APPROXIMATE THE MODEL/ TOWARDS SECURE TRANSACTION AND FAIR PRICING OF TRAINING DATA","abstract":"As machine learning becomes ubiquitous, deployed systems need to be as accu- rate as they can. As a result, machine learning service providers have a surging need for useful, additional training data that benefits training, without giving up all the details about the trained program. At the same time, data owners would like to trade their data for its value, without having to first give away the data itself be- fore receiving compensation. It is difficult for data providers and model providers to agree on a fair price without first revealing the data or the trained model to the other side. Escrow systems only complicate this further, adding an additional layer of trust required of both parties. Currently, data owners and model owners don’t have a fair pricing system that eliminates the need to trust a third party and training the model on the data, which 1) takes a long time to complete, 2) does not guarantee that useful data is paid valuably and that useless data isn’t, without trusting in the third party with both the model and the data. Existing improve- ments to secure the transaction focus heavily on encrypting or approximating the data, such as training on encrypted data, and variants of federated learning. As powerful as the methods appear to be, we show them to be impractical in our use case with real world assumptions for preserving privacy for the data owners when facing black-box models. Thus, a fair pricing scheme that does not rely on secure data encryption and obfuscation is needed before the exchange of data. This pa- per proposes a novel method for fair pricing using data-model efficacy techniques such as influence functions, model extraction, and model compression methods, thus enabling secure data transactions. We successfully show that without running the data through the model, one can approximate the value of the data; that is, if the data turns out redundant, the pricing is minimal, and if the data leads to proper improvement, its value is properly assessed, without placing strong assumptions on the nature of the model. Future work will be focused on establishing a system with stronger transactional security against adversarial attacks that will reveal details about the model or the data to the other party.","pdf":"/pdf/6b168938dbf6014d12195848c4dc000920a179b3.pdf","TL;DR":"Facing complex, black-box models, encrypting the data is not as usable as approximating the model and using it to price a potential transaction.","paperhash":"anonymous|dont_encrypt_the_data_just_approximate_the_model_towards_secure_transaction_and_fair_pricing_of_training_data","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018don’t,          \ntitle={DON’T ENCRYPT THE DATA, JUST APPROXIMATE THE MODEL/ TOWARDS SECURE TRANSACTION AND FAIR PRICING OF TRAINING DATA},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1102/Authors"],"keywords":["Security in Machine Learning","Information Security","Fairness and Privacy"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509143584081,"tcdate":1509138495670,"number":1101,"cdate":1509138495670,"id":"SyBBgXWAZ","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"SyBBgXWAZ","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Optimal transport maps for distribution preserving operations on latent spaces of Generative Models","abstract":"Generative models such as Variational Auto Encoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are typically trained for a fixed prior distribution in the latent space, such as uniform or Gaussian.\nAfter a trained model is obtained, one can sample the Generator in various forms for exploration and understanding, such as interpolating between two samples, sampling in the vicinity of a sample or exploring differences between a pair of samples applied to a third sample.\nIn this paper, we show that the latent space operations used in the literature so far induce a distribution mismatch between the resulting outputs and the prior distribution the model was trained on.

We propose to improve sample quality using Generative Adversarial Network (GANs), which explicitly train the generator to produce high quality samples and have shown a lot of success in image generation. GANs were originally to designed to output differentiable values, so discrete language generation is challenging for them. We introduce an actor-critic conditional GAN that fills in missing text conditioned on the surrounding context. We show qualitatively and quantitatively, evidence that this produces more realistic text samples compared to a maximum likelihood trained model.","pdf":"/pdf/0f1ccb61544842755137c3af63c473b6b44b5948.pdf","TL;DR":"Natural language GAN for filling in the blank","paperhash":"anonymous|maskgan_textual_generative_adversarial_networks_\\\\from_fillingintheblank","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018maskgan:,          \ntitle={MaskGAN: Textual Generative Adversarial Networks \\\\from filling-in-the-blank},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["Anonymous"],"keywords":["Deep learning","GAN"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509140490935,"tcdate":1509138479769,"number":1109,"cdate":1509138479769,"id":"By4Nxm-CW","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"By4Nxm-CW","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Do Convolutional Neural Networks act  as Compositional Nearest Neighbors?","abstract":"We present a simple approach based on pixel-wise nearest neighbors to understand and interpret the functioning of state-of-the-art neural networks for pixel-level tasks.

In this work we extend the method to handle RNNs by introducing a novel approximation to the FIM for RNNs. This approximation works by modelling the covariance structure between the gradient contributions at different time-steps using a chain-structured linear Gaussian graphical model, summing the various cross-covariances, and computing the inverse in closed form.

Different attack strategies have been proposed to generate adversarial examples, but how to produce them more efficiently and guarantee the diversity of adversarial perturbations requires more research efforts. In this paper, we propose AdvGAN to generate adversarial examples with generative adversarial networks (GANs), which can learn and preserve the distribution of original instances. For AdvGAN, once the generator is trained, it can generate an adversarial perturbation efficiently for any instance, and the generated adversarial examples have large variety depending on the underlying distribution, so as to accelerate adversarial training as defenses. We apply AdvGAN in both semi-whitebox and black-box attack settings. In semi-whitebox attacks, there is no need to access the original target model after the generator is trained, in contrast to traditional white-box attacks. In the black-box attack, we dynamically train a distilled model for the black-box and optimize the generator accordingly. Extensive experimental results show that black-box attacks based on AdvGAN can achieve comparable attack success rate with that of semi-whitebox settings. Adversarial examples generated by AdvGAN on different models have high attack success rate under state-of-the-art defenses compared with other attacks.

We introduce a model of structured alignments between sentences, showing how to compare two sentences by matching their latent structures. Using a structured attention mechanism, our model matches possible spans in the first sentence to possible spans in the second sentence, simultaneously discovering the tree structure of each sentence and performing a comparison, in a model that is fully differentiable and is trained only on the comparison objective.

A simple way to enforce the Lipschitz constraint on the class of functions, which can be modeled by the neural network, is weight clipping. Augmenting the loss by a regularization term that penalizes the deviation of the gradient norm of the critic (as a function of the network's input) from one, was proposed as an alternative that improves training. We present theoretical arguments why using a weaker regularization term enforcing the Lipschitz constraint is preferable.

Inferring the unseen ex- pert actions in a stochastic environment is challenging and usually infeasible when combined with a large state space. We propose a novel policy learning method which only utilizes the expert state sequences without inferring the unseen ac- tions.

The extracted sub-goals are also used to synthesize guidance rewards in the policy learning. We evaluate our agent on five Doom tasks.

So far it was unclear how much risk adversarial perturbations carry for the safety of real-world machine learning applications because most attack methods rely either on detailed model information (gradient-based attacks) or on confidence scores such as probability or logit outputs of the model (score-based attacks), neither of which are available in most real-world scenarios. In such cases, currently the only option are transfer-based attacks, however they need access to the training data, rely on cumbersome substitute models and are much easier to defend against. Here we introduce a new category of attacks - decision-based attacks - that rely solely on the final decision of a model. Decision-based attacks are therefore (1) applicable to real-world black-box models such as autonomous cars, (2) need less knowledge and are easier to apply than transfer-based attacks and (3) are more robust to simple defences than gradient-based or score-based attacks. As a first effective representative of this category we introduce the Boundary Attack. This attack is conceptually simple, extremely flexible, requires close to no hyperparameter tuning and yields adversarial perturbations that are competitive with those produced by the best gradient-based attacks in standard computer vision applications. We demonstrate the attack on two real-world black-box models from Clarifai.com. The Boundary Attack in particular and the class of decision-based attacks in general thus open new avenues to study the robustness of machine learning models and raise new questions regarding the safety of deployed machine learning systems.

We introduce a novel automated countermeasure called  Parallel Checkpointing Learners (PCL) to thwart the potential adversarial attacks and significantly improve the reliability (safety) of a victim DL model. The proposed PCL methodology is unsupervised, meaning that no adversarial sample is leveraged to build/train parallel checkpointing learners. We formalize the goal of preventing adversarial attacks as an optimization problem to minimize the rarely observed regions in the latent feature space spanned by a DL network. To solve the aforementioned minimization problem, a set of complementary but disjoint checkpointing modules are trained and leveraged to validate the victim model execution in parallel. Each checkpointing learner explicitly characterizes the geometry of the input data and the corresponding high-level data abstractions within a particular DL layer. As such, the adversary is required to simultaneously deceive all the defender modules in order to succeed. We extensively evaluate the performance of the PCL methodology against the state-of-the-art attack scenarios, including Fast-Gradient-Sign (FGS), Jacobian Saliency Map Attack (JSMA), Deepfool, and Carlini&WagnerL2. Extensive proof-of-concept evaluations for analyzing various data collections including MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet corroborate the effectiveness of our proposed defense mechanism against adversarial samples.

In particular, what is needed is a representation of the transformation manifold that can robustly capture the shape of the manifold from the input data, generate new points on the manifold, and extend transformations outside of the training domain without significantly increasing the error.

We then show that the method can capture highly non-linear invariances of the data by visualizing their effect in the data space.","pdf":"/pdf/1417b939577e252c1f8c08b510a5c3268c28f4d1.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|parametrizing_filters_of_a_cnn_with_a_gan","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018parametrizing,          \ntitle={Parametrizing filters of a CNN with a GAN},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["Anonymous"],"keywords":["invariance","cnn","gan","infogan","transformation"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509138201183,"tcdate":1509137842834,"number":1015,"cdate":1509137842834,"id":"BkLhaGZRW","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"BkLhaGZRW","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Improving diversity in Generative adversarial networks by encouraging discriminator representation entropy","abstract":"We propose a novel regularizer for the training of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) so that the generator can better capture the variations within the real data distribution, thus helps to avoid subtle model collapse and improve the performance of GANs.

Existing collaborative learning techniques (with the integration of the differential privacy concept) are shown to be resilient against a passive adversary which tries to infer the training data only from the resulting model parameters. However, recently, it has been shown that the existing collaborative learning techniques are vulnerable to an active adversary that runs a GAN attack during the learning phase.

We propose a collaborative learning technique in which class scores of each participant are protected by class-specific keys.

A recent approach for finding a common representation of the two domains is via domain adversarial training (Ganin & Lempitsky, 2015), which attempts to induce a feature extractor that matches the source and target feature distributions in some feature space. However, domain adversarial training faces two critical limitations: 1) if the feature extraction function has high-capacity, feature distribution matching is under-constrained, 2) in the non-conservative domain adaptation setting, where no single classifier can perform well jointly in both the source and target domains, domain adversarial training is over-constrained. In this paper, we address these issues through the lense of the cluster assumption, i.e., decision boundaries should not cross high-density data regions. We propose two novel and related models: (1) the Virtual Adversarial Domain Adaptation (VADA) model, which combines domain adversarial training with a penalty term that punishes the violation the cluster assumption; (2) the Decision-boundary Iterative Refinement Training with a Teacher (DIRT-T)1 model, which takes the VADA model as initialization and employs natural gradient steps to further minimize the cluster assumption violation. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that the combination of these two models significantly improve the state-of-the-art performance on several visual domain adaptation benchmarks.","pdf":"/pdf/5d214b5eddd3ea75309ac7e2b2c203a4d01fd636.pdf","TL;DR":"SOTA on unsupervised domain adaptation by leveraging the cluster assumption.","paperhash":"anonymous|a_dirtt_approach_to_unsupervised_domain_adaptation","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018a,          \ntitle={A DIRT-T Approach to Unsupervised Domain Adaptation},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["Anonymous"],"keywords":["domain adaptation","unsupervised learning","semi-supervised learning"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509142278663,"tcdate":1509137665940,"number":987,"cdate":1509137665940,"id":"SkHl6MWC-","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"SkHl6MWC-","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"REGULARIZATION NEURAL NETWORKS VIA CONSTRAINED VIRTUAL MOVEMENT FILED","abstract":"We provide a novel thinking of regularization neural networks.

In this work, we propose a Recurrent GAN (RGAN) and Recurrent Conditional GAN (RCGAN) to produce realistic real-valued multi-dimensional time series, with an emphasis on their application to medical data. RGANs make use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in the generator and the discriminator. In the case of RCGANs, both of these RNNs are conditioned on auxiliary information. We demonstrate our models in a set of toy datasets, where we show visually and quantitatively (using sample likelihood and maximum mean discrepancy) that they can successfully generate realistic time-series. We also describe novel evaluation methods for GANs, where we generate a synthetic labelled training dataset, and evaluate on a real test set the performance of a model trained on the synthetic data, and vice-versa. We illustrate with these metrics that RCGANs can generate time-series data useful for supervised training, with only minor degradation in performance on real test data. This is demonstrated on digit classification from ‘serialised’ MNIST and by training an early warning system on a medical dataset of 17,000 patients from an intensive care unit.

However, when humans perform this task they do not just focus on option selection but use a combination of \\textit{elimination} and \\textit{selection}. Specifically, a human would first try to eliminate the most irrelevant option and then read the document again in the light of this new information (and perhaps ignore portions corresponding to the eliminated option). This process could be repeated multiple times till the reader is finally ready to select the correct option. We propose \\textit{ElimiNet}, a neural network based model which tries to mimic this process. Specifically, it has gates which decide whether an option can be eliminated given the \\{\\textit{document, question}\\} pair and if so it tries to make the document representation orthogonal to this eliminatedd option (akin to ignoring portions of the document corresponding to the eliminated option). The model makes multiple rounds of partial elimination to refine the document representation and finally uses a selection module to pick the best option.

Moreover, although this complexity allows DNNs to learn complex mappings, it may also allow them to over-fit, which has motivated the use of regularization methods, e.g., by encouraging weight sparsity. Another well-known approach for controlling the complexity of DNNs is parameter sharing/tying, where certain sets of weights are forced to share a common value. Some forms of weight sharing are hard-wired to express certain in- variances, with a notable example being the shift-invariance of convolutional layers. However, there may be other groups of weights that may be tied together during the learning process, thus further re- ducing the complexity of the network. In this paper, we adopt a recently proposed sparsity-inducing regularizer, named GrOWL (group ordered weighted l1), which encourages sparsity and, simulta- neously, learns which groups of parameters should share a common value. GrOWL has been proven effective in linear regression, being able to identify and cope with strongly correlated covariates. Unlike standard sparsity-inducing regularizers (e.g., l1 a.k.a. Lasso), GrOWL not only eliminates unimportant neurons by setting all the corresponding weights to zero, but also explicitly identifies strongly correlated neurons by tying the corresponding weights to a common value. This ability of GrOWL motivates the following two-stage procedure: (i) use GrOWL regularization in the training process to simultaneously identify significant neurons and groups of parameter that should be tied together; (ii) retrain the network, enforcing the structure that was unveiled in the previous phase, i.e., keeping only the significant neurons and enforcing the learned tying structure. We evaluate the proposed approach on several benchmark datasets, showing that it can dramatically compress the network with slight or even no loss on generalization performance.\n","pdf":"/pdf/de66b05d0b99c974929def1ab7fe115679c6582f.pdf","TL;DR":"We have proposed using the recent GrOWL regularizer for simultaneous parameter sparsity and tying in DNN learning.

A common remedy is to “warm-start” the agent by pre-training it to mimic expert demonstrations, but this is prone to overfitting. Instead, we propose to constrain exploration using demonstrations. From each demonstration, we induce high-level “workflows” which constrain the allowable actions at each time step to be similar to those in the demonstration (e.g., “Step 1: click on a textbox; Step 2: enter some text”). Our exploration pol- icy then learns to identify successful workflows and samples actions that satisfy these workflows. Workflows prune out bad exploration directions and accelerate the agent’s ability to discover rewards. We use our approach to train a novel neural policy designed to handle the semi-structured nature of websites, and evaluate on a suite of web tasks, including the recent World of Bits benchmark.

Using a subset of houses in this environment, we study the task of RoomNav in which an agent navigates towards a target specified by a high-level instruction. For this, the agent learns to comprehend the scene it lives in by developing perception, understand the instruction by mapping it to the correct semantics, and navigate to the target by obeying the underlying physical laws. We tackle this problem by training RL agents with gated-attention networks and show that our trained agent succeeds in new unseen environments, showing generalization capability. In particular, we observe that (1) training is substantially harder on large house sets but with better generalization, (2) using semantic signals (e.g., segmentation mask) boosts the generalization performance, and (3) gating mechanism helps more about the training but less about the generalization. We hope House3D, as well as the analysis of RoomNav task, acts as a step towards building a practical intelligent system and can potentially benefit the community.

Standard CNN architectures are modified through the incorporation of this module, and trained under the constraint that a convex combination of the intermediate 2D feature vectors, as parametrised by the score matrices, must alone be used for classification.

One of our motivations is to explore how biologically realistic features, like recurrent relationships between neuron-like units and resemblance to neural dynamics (key features of RCNs), contribute to the learning capabilities of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Specifically, we show that an RCN trained to identify strong similarities or transformations between image pairs drawn from a subset of digits from the MNIST database generalizes the learned transformations to images of digits unseen during training. We observe that the high dimensional reservoir states generated from an input image pair with a specific transformation converge over time to a unique relationship. Thus, as opposed to training the entire high dimensional reservoir state, the reservoir only needs to train on these unique relationships, allowing the reservoir to perform well with very few training examples. The directions of the principal component of the time-projected reservoir states representing input image pairs with the same relationship are aligned closer together than those representing image pairs with different relationships. Thus, generalization of learning to unseen images is interpretable in terms of clustering of the reservoir state onto the attractor corresponding to the transformation in reservoir space. We find that RCNs can identify and generalize linear and non-linear transformations, and combinations of transformations, naturally and be a robust and effective image classifier. Additionally, RCNs perform significantly better than state of the art neural network classification techniques such as deep siamese neural networks in generalization tasks both on the MNIST dataset and more complex depth maps of visual scenes from a moving camera. This helps bridge the gap between machine learning and the biological problem of human cognition, and points to new directions in the investigation of learning processes.","pdf":"/pdf/8bf870b2b07b44ac87e15008f27d94ed52297932.pdf","TL;DR":"Generalization of the relationships learnt between pairs of images using a small training data to previously unseen types of images using a biologically plausible model, Reservoir Computing.","paperhash":"anonymous|generalization_of_learning_using_reservoir_computing","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018generalization,          \ntitle={Generalization of Learning using Reservoir Computing},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["Anonymous"],"keywords":["Generalization","Reservoir Computing","dynamical system","Siamese Neural Network","image classification","similarity","dimensionality reduction"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509138033860,"tcdate":1509137363084,"number":945,"cdate":1509137363084,"id":"rJNpifWAb","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"rJNpifWAb","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Flipout: Efficient Pseudo-Independent Weight Perturbations on Mini-Batches","abstract":"Stochastic neural net weights are used in a variety of contexts, including regularization, Bayesian neural nets, exploration in reinforcement learning, and evolution strategies.

However, existing approaches largely ignore this coupling, instead choosing to alternate between separate design and control phases, which requires expert intuition throughout and risks convergence to suboptimal designs. In this work, we propose a method that jointly optimizes over the physical design of a robot and the corresponding control policy in a model-free fashion, without any need for expert supervision. Given an arbitrary robot morphology, our method maintains a distribution over the design parameters and uses reinforcement learning to train a neural network controller. Throughout training, we refine the robot distribution to maximize the expected reward. This results in an assignment to the robot parameters and neural network policy that are jointly optimal. We evaluate our approach in the context of legged locomotion, and demonstrate that it discovers novel robot designs and walking gaits for several different morphologies, achieving performance comparable to or better than that of hand-crafted designs.","pdf":"/pdf/61209d2fa0c99fe17b00d5e5c2decb02599cf2f4.pdf","TL;DR":"Use deep reinforcement learning to design the physical attributes of a robot jointly with a control policy.","paperhash":"anonymous|jointly_learning_to_construct_and_control_agents_using_deep_reinforcement_learning","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018jointly,          \ntitle={Jointly Learning to Construct and Control Agents using Deep Reinforcement Learning},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["Anonymous"],"keywords":["robot locomotion","reinforcement learning","policy gradients","physical design","deep learning"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509138189275,"tcdate":1509137285978,"number":938,"cdate":1509137285978,"id":"r1NYjfbR-","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"r1NYjfbR-","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Analyzing GANs with Generative Scattering Networks","abstract":"GANs provide spectacular image generations from Gaussian white noise, which interpolate images through deformations, with little mathematical justifications.

There have been several results that show better gradient estimates, using weighted non-uniform sampling, which leads to faster convergence.

In this paper, we break this chicken-and-egg loop and provide the first demonstration of a sampling scheme, which leads to superior gradient estimation, while keeping the sampling cost per iteration similar to the uniform sampling.

We argue that reading the entire input is not always necessary in practice, since a lot of reviews are often easy to classify, i.e., a decision can be formed after reading some crucial sentences or words in the provided text. In this paper, we present an approach of fast reading for text classification. Inspired by several well-known human reading techniques, our approach implements an intelligent recurrent agent which evaluates the importance of the current snippet in order to decide whether to make a prediction, or to skip some texts, or to re-read part of the sentence. Our agent uses an RNN module to encode information from the past and the current tokens, and applies a policy module to form decisions. With an end-to-end training algorithm based on policy gradient, we train and test our agent on several text classification datasets and achieve both higher efficiency and better accuracy compared to previous approaches. \n","pdf":"/pdf/748926bc02b774ab9382a6589bd0940a11059f4b.pdf","TL;DR":"We develop an end-to-end trainable approach for skimming, rereading and early stopping applicable to seq2scalar tasks.

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that jointly learns and compresses a neural network. The key idea in our approach is to change the optimization criteria by adding $k$ independent Gaussian priors over the parameters and a sparsity penalty. We show that our approach is easy to implement using existing neural network libraries, generalizes L1 and L2 regularization and elegantly enforces parameter tying as well as pruning constraints.

First, we propose a natural way of specifying the loss function for GANs by drawing a connection with supervised learning. Second, we shed light on the statistical performance of GANs through the analysis of a simple LQG setting: the generator is linear, the loss function is quadratic and the data is drawn from a Gaussian distribution. We show that  in this setting: 1) the optimal GAN solution converges to population Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as the number of training samples increases; 2) the number of samples required scales exponentially with the dimension of the data; 3) the number of samples scales almost linearly if the discriminator is constrained to be quadratic.

In the stochastic case, the popular explanations for their wide applicability is that when these fast gradient methods are applied in the stochastic case, they partially mimic their exact gradient counterparts, resulting in some practical gain. This work provides a counterpoint to this belief by proving that there are simple problem instances where these methods cannot outperform SGD despite the best setting of its parameters.

With more than hundreds of Transcription Factors (TFs) as labels, genomic-sequence based TFBS prediction is a challenging multi-label classification task. There are two major biological mechanisms for TF binding: (1) sequence-specific binding patterns on genomes known as “motifs” and (2) interactions among TFs known as co-binding effects. In this paper, we propose a novel deep architecture, the Prototype Matching Network (PMN) to mimic the TF binding mechanisms. Our PMN model automatically extracts prototypes (“motif”-like features) for each TF through a novel prototype-matching loss. Borrowing ideas from few-shot matching models, we use the notion of support set of prototypes and an LSTM to learn how TFs interact and bind to genomic sequences. On a reference TFBS dataset with 2.1 million genomic sequences, PMN significantly outperforms baselines and validates our design choices empirically. To our knowledge, this is the first deep learning architecture that introduces prototype learning and considers TF-TF interactions for large scale TFBS prediction. Not only is the proposed architecture accurate, but it also models the underlying biology.","pdf":"/pdf/ae4cfb2d369c4359baf433a390382fa790b5bb48.pdf","TL;DR":"We combine the matching network framework for few shot learning into a large scale multi-label model for genomic sequence classification.","paperhash":"anonymous|prototype_matching_networks_for_largescale_multilabel_genomic_sequence_classification","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018prototype,          \ntitle={Prototype Matching Networks for Large-Scale Multi-label  Genomic Sequence Classification},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper878/Authors"],"keywords":["bioinformatics","multi-label classification","matching networks","prototypes","memory networks","attention"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509225926418,"tcdate":1509136610162,"number":878,"cdate":1509136610162,"id":"rk9kKMZ0-","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"rk9kKMZ0-","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"LEAP: Learning Embeddings for Adaptive Pace","abstract":"The parameterization of mini-batches for training Deep Neural Networks (DNN) is a non-trivial problem.

This expertise is effective but expensive supervision: it is not always practical to collect many detailed demonstrations. We argue that if an agent has access to its environment along with the expert, it can learn skills from its own experience and rely on expertise for the goals alone. We weaken the expert supervision required to a single visual demonstration of the task, that is, observation of the expert without knowledge of the actions. Our method is ``zero-shot'' in that we never see expert actions and never see demonstrations during learning. Through self-supervised exploration our agent learns to act and to recognize its actions so that it can infer expert actions once given a demonstration in deployment. During training the agent learns a skill policy for reaching a target observation from the current observation. During inference, the expert demonstration communicates the goals to imitate while the skill policy determines how to imitate. Our novel skill policy architecture and dynamics consistency loss extend visual imitation to more complex environments while improving robustness. Our zero-shot imitator, having no prior knowledge of the environment and making no use of the expert during training, learns from experience to follow experts for navigating an office with a turtlebot, and manipulating rope with a baxter robot.

This makes BPTT both computationally impractical and biologically implausible. For this reason, full backpropagation through time is rarely used on long sequences, and truncated backpropagation through time is used as a heuristic.  However, this usually leads to biased estimates of the gradient in which longer term dependencies are ignored.  Addressing this issue, we propose an alternative algorithm, Sparse Attentive Backtracking, which might also be related to principles used by brains to learn long-term dependencies. Sparse Attentive Backtracking learns an attention mechanism over the hidden states of the past and selectively backpropagates through paths with high attention weights.  This allows the model to learn long term dependencies while only backtracking for a small number of time steps, not just from the recent past but also from attended relevant past states.

In our scheme, a model learns to classify accurately and fairly, but also to defer if necessary, passing judgment to a downstream decision-maker such as a human user. We propose a learning algorithm which accounts for potential biases held by decision-makers later in a pipeline.

However, learning an appropriate hierarchical decomposition of a domain into subtasks remains a substantial challenge. We present a novel algorithm for subtask discovery, based on the recently introduced multitask linearly-solvable Markov decision process (MLMDP) framework. The MLMDP can perform never-before-seen tasks by representing them as a linear combination of a previously learned basis set of tasks. In this setting, the subtask discovery problem can naturally be posed as finding an optimal low-rank approximation of the set of tasks the agent will face in a domain. We use non-negative matrix factorization to discover this minimal basis set of tasks, and show that the technique learns intuitive decompositions in a variety of domains. Our method has several qualitatively desirable features: it is not limited to learning subtasks with single goal states, instead learning distributed patterns of preferred states; it learns qualitatively different hierarchical decompositions in the same domain depending on the ensemble of tasks the agent will face; and it may be straightforwardly iterated to obtain deeper hierarchical decompositions.","pdf":"/pdf/ae92b2fb4226151d0689cd7fcc959a61202bf663.pdf","TL;DR":"We present a novel algorithm for hierarchical subtask discovery which leverages the multitask linear Markov decision process framework.","paperhash":"anonymous|hierarchical_subtask_discovery_with_nonnegative_matrix_factorization","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018hierarchical,          \ntitle={Hierarchical Subtask Discovery with Non-Negative Matrix Factorization},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper865/Authors"],"keywords":["Reinforcement Learning","Hierarchy","Subtask Discovery","Linear Markov Decision Process"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509137548296,"tcdate":1509136295847,"number":864,"cdate":1509136295847,"id":"SJlhPMWAW","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"SJlhPMWAW","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"GraphVAE: Towards Generation of Small Graphs Using Variational Autoencoders","abstract":"Deep learning on graphs has become a popular research topic with many applications.

In this paper, we argue that information from larger neighborhoods, such as from more directions and from greater distances, will better characterize the relationship between adversarial examples and the DNN models. First, we introduce an attack, OPTMARGIN, that generates adversarial examples robust to small perturbations. These examples successfully evade a defense that only considers a small ball around an input instance. Second, we analyze a larger neighborhood around input instances by looking at properties of surrounding decision boundaries, namely the distances to the boundaries and the adjacent classes. We find that the boundaries around these adversarial examples do not resemble the boundaries around benign examples. Finally, we show that, under scrutiny of the surrounding decision boundaries, our OPTMARGIN examples do not convincingly mimic benign examples. Although our experiments are limited to a few specific attacks, we hope these findings will motivate new, more evasive attacks and ultimately, effective defenses.","pdf":"/pdf/5a5655b784efcefff81c2fd53d3ed8a2c475e23f.pdf","TL;DR":"Looking at decision boundaries around an input gives you more information than a fixed small neighborhood","paperhash":"anonymous|decision_boundary_analysis_of_adversarial_examples","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018decision,          \ntitle={Decision Boundary Analysis of Adversarial Examples},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper862/Authors"],"keywords":["adversarial machine learning","supervised representation learning","decision regions","decision boundaries"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509136261393,"tcdate":1509136261164,"number":860,"cdate":1509136261164,"id":"HkpYwMZRb","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"HkpYwMZRb","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Gradients explode - Deep Networks are shallow - ResNet explained","abstract":"Whereas it is believed that techniques such as Adam, batch normalization and, more recently, SeLU nonlinearities ``solve'' the exploding gradient problem, we show that this is not the case and that in a range of popular MLP architectures, exploding gradients exist and that they limit the depth to which networks can be effectively trained, both in theory and in practice.

A routing network is a kind of self-organizing neural network consisting of two components: a router and a set of one or more function blocks. A function block may be any neural network – for example a fully-connected or a convolutional layer. Given an input the router makes a routing decision, choosing a function block to apply and passing the output back to the router recursively, terminating when the router decides to stop or a fixed recursion depth is reached. In this way the routing network dynamically composes different function blocks for each input. We employ a collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to jointly train the router and function blocks. We evaluate our model on multi-task settings of the MNIST, mini-ImageNet, and CIFAR-100 datasets.

In this work, we study the information bottleneck (IB) theory of deep learning, which makes three specific claims: first, that deep networks undergo two distinct phases consisting of an initial fitting phase and a subsequent compression phase; second, that the compression phase is causally related to the excellent generalization performance of deep networks; and third, that the compression phase occurs due to the diffusion-like behavior of stochastic gradient descent. Here we show that none of these claims hold true in the general case. Through a combination of analytical results and simulation, we demonstrate that the information plane trajectory is predominantly a function of the neural nonlinearity employed: double-sided saturating nonlinearities like tanh yield a compression phase as neural activations enter the saturation regime, but linear activation functions and single-sided saturating nonlinearities like the widely used ReLU in fact do not. Using recent results on generalization error dynamics in linear neural networks, we show that there is no evident causal connection between compression and generalization: networks that do not compress are still capable of generalization, and vice versa. We also show that the compression phase, when it exists, does not require any stochasticity in training by demonstrating that we can replicate the IB findings using full batch gradient descent rather than stochastic gradient descent. Finally, we show that when an input domain consists of a subset of task-relevant and task-irrelevant information, hidden representations do compress the task-irrelevant information, although the overall information about the input my monotonically increase with training time, and that this compression happens concurrently with the fitting process rather than during a subsequent compression period.","pdf":"/pdf/a12ea1130852573a3a9c7c8643ff604f34824562.pdf","TL;DR":"We show that several claims of the information bottleneck theory of deep learning are not true in the general case.","paperhash":"anonymous|on_the_information_bottleneck_theory_of_deep_learning","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018on,          \ntitle={On the Information Bottleneck Theory of Deep Learning},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper852/Authors"],"keywords":["information bottleneck","deep learning","deep linear networks"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509136080381,"tcdate":1509136080119,"number":851,"cdate":1509136080119,"id":"SJdCUMZAW","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"SJdCUMZAW","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Data-efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dexterous Manipulation","abstract":"Grasping an object and precisely stacking it on another is a difficult task for traditional robotic control or hand-engineered approaches.

We empirically show that our performance prediction models are much more effective than prominent Bayesian counterparts, are simpler to implement, and are faster to train. Our models can predict final performance in both visual classification and language modeling domains, are effective for predicting performance of drastically varying model architectures, and can even generalize between model classes.

Finally, we empirically show that our early stopping method can be seamlessly incorporated into both reinforcement learning-based architecture selection algorithms and bandit based search methods.

On the other hand, the generator and the discriminator are parametrized in terms of deep convolutional neural networks. The goal of this paper is to disentangle the contribution of these two factors to the success of GANs. In particular, we introduce Generative Latent Optimization (GLO), a framework to train deep convolutional generators without using discriminators, thus avoiding the instability of adversarial optimization problems.

In this paper, we find 99.9% of the gradient exchange in distributed SGD is redundant, and propose Deep Gradient Compression (DGC) to greatly reduce the communication bandwidth. To preserve accuracy during compression, DGC employs four methods: momentum correction, local gradient clipping, momentum factor masking, and warm-up training. We have applied Deep Gradient Compression to image classification, speech recognition, and language modeling with multiple datasets including Cifar10, ImageNet, Penn Treebank, and Librispeech Corpus. On these scenarios, Deep Gradient Compression achieves a gradient compression ratio from 270x to 600x without losing accuracy, cutting the gradient size of ResNet-50 from 97MB to 0.35MB, and for DeepSpeech from 488MB to 0.74MB.

This paper proposes a novel semantic program embedding that is learned from program execution traces. Our key insight is that program states expressed as sequential tuples of live variable values not only captures program semantics more precisely, but also offer a more natural ﬁt for Recurrent Neural Networks to model. We evaluate different syntactic and semantic program embeddings on predicting the types of errors that students make in their submissions to an introductory programming class and two exercises on the CodeHunt education platform.

This observation demonstrates that with the existing theory, we cannot adequately explain why stochastic gradient methods can find generalizable solutions for neural networks. In this work, we use a Fourier-based approach to study the generalization properties of gradient-based methods over 2-layer neural networks with sinusoidal activation functions. We prove that if the underlying distribution of data has nice spectral properties such as bandlimitedness, then gradient-based methods will converge to generalizable local minima.

The difficulty of training deep networks is partly due to the singularities caused by the non-identifiability of the model. Two such singularities have been identified in previous work: (i) overlap singularities caused by the permutation symmetry of nodes in a given layer and (ii) elimination singularities corresponding to the elimination, i.e. consistent deactivation, of nodes. These singularities cause degenerate manifolds in the loss landscape previously shown to slow down learning. We argue that skip connections eliminate these singularities by breaking the permutation symmetry of nodes and by reducing the possibility of node elimination. Moreover, for typical initializations, skip connections move the network away from the \"ghosts\" of these singularities and sculpt the landscape around them to alleviate the learning slow-down.

In order to deal with complex terrain observations and policy learning, we propose a value iteration recurrence, referred to as the soft value iteration network (SVIN). SVIN is designed to produce more effective training gradients through the value iteration network.

We consider a subclass of these games, named Markov potential games (MPGs), that appear often in economic and engineering applications, where the agents share or compete for some common resource, the state-action sets are continuous, rewards might be nonconvex functions, and there might be coupled constraints. Previous analysis followed a variational approach that is only valid for very simple cases (convex rewards, invertible dynamics, and no coupled constraints); or considered deterministic dynamics and provided open-loop (OL) analysis, studying strategies that consist in predefined action sequences, which are not optimal for stochastic environments. We present a closed-loop (CL) analysis for MPGs and consider policies that depend on the current state and where agents adapt to stochastic transitions. Following state-of-the-art results for single-agent problems obtained with deep-reinforcement-learning, we consider the agents' policies belong to some parametric class (e.g., deep neural networks). We provide sufficient and necessary, easily verifiable conditions for a stochastic game to be an MPG, and show that a closed-loop Nash equilibrium can be found (or at least approximated) by solving a related optimal control problem (OCP). This is useful since solving an OCP---which is a single-objective problem---is usually much simpler than solving the original set of coupled OCPs that form the game---which is a multiobjective control problem. This is a considerable improvement over the previously standard approach for the CL analysis of MPGs, which gives no approximate solution if no Nash equilibrium belongs to the chosen parametric family, and which is practical only for simple parametric forms. We illustrate the theoretical contributions with an example by applying our approach to a noncooperative communications engineering game. We then solve the game with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm and learn a set of policies (one per agent) that closely approximates an exact variational Nash equilibrium of the game.","pdf":"/pdf/db5f02eca6f3c74ec9a9c411db46cb4fec131e2d.pdf","TL;DR":"We present general closed loop analysis for Markov potential games and show that deep reinforcement learning can be used for learning approximate closed-loop Nash equilibrium.","paperhash":"anonymous|learning_approximate_closedloop_policies_for_markov_potential_games","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018learning,          \ntitle={Learning Approximate Closed-Loop Policies for Markov Potential Games},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper817/Authors"],"keywords":["Stochastic games","potential games","closed loop","reinforcement learning","multiagent systems"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509135362204,"tcdate":1509135359800,"number":816,"cdate":1509135359800,"id":"Byd-EfWCb","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"Byd-EfWCb","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Decoding Decoders: Finding Optimal Representation Spaces for Unsupervised Similarity Tasks","abstract":"Experimental evidence indicates that shallow bag-of-words models outperform complex deep networks on many unsupervised similarity tasks.

Because neural sequence models such as RNN are more amenable for handling token-like input, we propose two methods for time-dependent event representation, based on the intuition on how time is tokenized in everyday life and previous work on embedding contextualization. We also introduce two methods for using next event duration as regularization for training a sequence prediction model. We discuss these methods based on recurrent neural nets. We evaluate these methods as well as baseline models on five datasets that resemble a variety of sequence prediction tasks. The experiments revealed that the proposed methods offer accuracy gain over baseline models in a range of settings.","pdf":"/pdf/99fb65f7b345e1de43290a89aa9eae5337455145.pdf","TL;DR":"Proposed methods for time-dependent event representation and regularization for sequence prediction; Evaluated these methods on five datasets that involve a range of sequence prediction tasks.","paperhash":"anonymous|timedependent_representation_for_neural_event_sequence_prediction","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018time-dependent,          \ntitle={Time-Dependent Representation for Neural Event Sequence Prediction},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper813/Authors"],"keywords":["Neural sequence prediction","Embedding","LSTM","Regularization"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509141050356,"tcdate":1509135307442,"number":812,"cdate":1509135307442,"id":"B1X0mzZCW","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"B1X0mzZCW","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Fidelity-Weighted Learning","abstract":"Training deep neural networks requires many training samples, but in practice training labels are expensive to obtain and may be of varying quality, as some may be from trusted expert labelers while others might be from heuristics or other sources of weak supervision such as crowd-sourcing.

Recently, it was shown that CNNs can exploit other invariances, such as rotation invariance, by using group convolutions instead of planar convolutions. However, for reasons of performance and ease of implementation, it has been necessary to limit the group convolution to transformations that can be applied to the filters without interpolation. Thus, for images with square pixels, only integer translations, rotations by multiples of 90 degrees, and reflections are admissible.\n\nWhereas the square tiling provides a 4-fold rotational symmetry, a hexagonal tiling of the plane has a 6-fold rotational symmetry. In this paper we show how one can efficiently implement planar convolution and group convolution over hexagonal lattices, by re-using existing highly optimized convolution routines. We find that, due to the reduced anisotropy of hexagonal filters, planar HexaConv provides better accuracy than planar convolution with square filters, given a fixed parameter budget. Furthermore, we find that the increased degree of symmetry of the hexagonal grid increases the effectiveness of group convolutions, by allowing for more parameter sharing.

Existing models based on LSTMs require a large number of parameters to support external memory and do not generalize well for long sequence inputs.

Hence, for longer sequence inputs the intermediate memory components proportionally scale in size resulting in poor inference times and high computation costs.\n\nIn this paper, we present Adaptive Memory Networks (AMN) that process input question pairs to dynamically construct a network architecture optimized for lower inference times. During inference, AMN parses input text into entities within different memory slots. However, distinct from previous approaches, AMN is a dynamic network architecture that creates variable numbers of memory banks weighted by question relevance. Thus, the decoder can select a variable number of memory banks to construct an answer using fewer banks, creating a runtime trade-off between accuracy and speed. \n\nAMN is enabled by first, a novel bank controller that makes discrete decisions with high accuracy and second, the capabilities of a dynamic framework (such as PyTorch) that allow for dynamic network sizing and efficient variable mini-batching. In our results, we demonstrate that our model learns to construct a varying number of memory banks based on task complexity and achieves faster inference times for standard bAbI tasks, and modified bAbI tasks.

An important known issue for such methods is separating relevant biological signal from nuisance variation. For example, the embedding vectors tend to be more correlated for cells that were cultured and imaged during the same week than for cells from a different week, despite having identical drug compounds applied in both cases.  In this case, the particular batch a set of experiments were conducted in constitutes the domain of the data; an ideal set of image embeddings should contain only the relevant biological information (e.g. drug effects).\nWe develop a method for adjusting the image embeddings in order to `forget' domain-specific information\nwhile preserving relevant biological information.

As such, previous work has not identified the correspondence between using these kernels as the covariance function for a GP and performing fully Bayesian prediction with a deep neural network.

We then use the resulting GP to perform Bayesian inference for deep neural networks on MNIST and CIFAR-10. We find that the GP-based predictions are competitive and can outperform neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent.

However, since gradient descent is not applicable to hard-threshold functions, it is not clear how to learn them in a principled way. We address this problem by observing that setting targets for hard-threshold hidden units in order to minimize loss is a discrete optimization problem, and can be solved as such. The discrete optimization goal is to find a set of targets such that each unit, including the output, has a linearly separable problem to solve. Given these targets, the network decomposes into individual perceptrons, which can then be learned with standard convex approaches. Based on this, we develop a recursive mini-batch algorithm for learning deep hard-threshold networks that includes the popular but poorly justified straight-through estimator as a special case.

Moreover, through analysis of a formal computational model we show that an unbounded sequence is necessary for scalability. Graph2Seq is also reversible, allowing full recovery of the graph structure from the sequence. Experimental evaluations of Graph2Seq on a variety of combinatorial optimization problems show strong generalization and strict improvement over state of the art.

However, in some cases, this strategy can be suboptimal,  since by focusing on a specific passage, it becomes difficult to leverage multiple mentions of the same answer throughout the document. In this work, we take a different approach by constructing lightweight models that are combined in a cascade to find the answer.

Using the theory of compressed sensing we show that representations combining the constituent word vectors are essentially information-preserving linear measurements of BonG representations of text. This leads to a new theoretical result about LSTMs: low-dimensional embeddings derived from a low-memory LSTM are provably at least as powerful on classification tasks, up to small error, as a linear classifier over BonG vectors, a result that extensive empirical work has thus far been unable to establish. Our experimental results support these theoretical findings and establish strong, simple, and unsupervised baselines on standard benchmarks that in some cases are state of the art among word-level methods.

In this paper we consider a defense method that is based on the \\emph{semantics} of $F$. Our starting point is the common \\emph{manifold assumption}, which states that natural data points lie on separate low dimensional manifolds for different classes. We then make a further postulate which states that \\emph{(a good model) $F$ is confident on natural points on the manifolds, but has low confidence on points outside of the manifolds,} where a natural measure of ``confident behavior'' is $\\|F(\\bfx)\\|_\\infty$  (i.e. how confident $F$ is about its prediction). Under this postulate, an adversarial example becomes a point that is outside of the low dimensional manifolds which $F$ has learned, but is still close to at least one manifold under some distance metric. Therefore, defending against adversarial perturbations becomes embedding an adversarial point back to the nearest manifold where natural points are drawn from. We propose algorithms to formalize this intuition and perform a preliminary evaluation. Noting that the effectiveness of our method depends on both how well $F$ satisfies the postulate and how effective we can conduct the embedding, we use a model trained recently by Madry et al., as the \\emph{base model}, and use \\emph{gradient based optimization}, such as the \\emph{Carlini-Wagner attack} (but now they are used for defense), as the \\emph{embedding procedure}.

This is important as high false positive rates are a serious issue with lung cancer diagnosis. We have found that AlexNet is not well suited to the problem of nodule identiﬁcation, though it is a good baseline comparison because of its ﬂexibility.","pdf":"/pdf/0bb106f868a018c1afc5dae4052c427d95fcf3b4.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|lung_tumor_location_and_identification_with_alexnet_and_a_custom_cnn","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018lung,          \ntitle={Lung Tumor Location and Identification with AlexNet and a Custom CNN},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper751/Authors"],"keywords":[]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509134114573,"tcdate":1509134114324,"number":750,"cdate":1509134114324,"id":"r1cXkf-A-","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"r1cXkf-A-","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Attribute-aware Collaborative Filtering: Survey and Classification","abstract":"Attribute-aware CF models aims at rating prediction given not only the historical rating from users to items, but also the information associated with users (e.g. age),  items (e.g. price),  or even ratings (e.g. rating time).

We show that for various network architectures, for both regression and classification tasks, and on both synthetic and real datasets, GradNorm improves accuracy and reduces overfitting over single networks, static baselines, and other adaptive multitask loss balancing techniques.

Furthermore, cfKG can be generalized, following Wu et al.

We focus on a particular problem where one aims at generating samples corresponding to a number of objects under various views. We assume that the distribution of the data is driven by two independent latent factors: the content, which represents the intrinsic features of an object, and the view, which stands for the settings of a particular observation of that object. Therefore, we propose a generative model and a conditional variant built on such a disentangled latent space. This approach allows us to generate realistic samples corresponding to various objects in a high variety of views. Unlike many multi-view approaches, our model doesn't need any supervision on the views but only on the content. Compared to other conditional generation approaches that are mostly based on binary or categorical attributes, we make no such assumption about the factors of variations. Our model can be used on problems with a huge, potentially infinite, number of categories.

This mechanism not only provides dense additional learning signals on what states lead to success, but also allows the agent to retain only this tendency reward instead of the whole histories of experience during multi-phase curriculum learning. We extensively study the advantages of our method on the standard sparse reward domains like Maze and Super Mario Bros and show that our method performs more efficiently and robustly than prior approaches in tasks with long time horizons and large state space.

The main takeaway lesson from our study is that mechanisms of human vision, particularly the hierarchal organization of the visual ventral stream should be taken into account in clustering algorithms (e.g., for learning representations in an unsupervised manner or with minimum supervision) to reach human level clustering performance.

We show that the functional form of this uncertainty is independent of architecture, dataset, and training protocol; and depends only on the statistics of the logit differences of the network, which do not change significantly during training. This leads to adversarial error having a universal scaling, as a power-law, with respect to the size of the adversarial perturbation. We show that this universality holds for a broad range of datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, ImageNet, and random data), models (including state-of-the-art deep networks, linear models, adversarially trained networks, and networks trained on randomly shuffled labels), and attacks (FGSM, step l.l., PGD).

To achieve this goal, Incomplete Dot Product (IDP) has been proposed to use only a subset of terms in dot products during forward propagation. However, there are some limitations, including noticeable performance degradation in operating regions with low computational costs, and essential performance limitations since IDP used hand-crafted profile coefficients. In this paper, we extend IDP by proposing new training algorithms involving a single profile, which may be trainable or pre-determined, to significantly improve the overall performance, especially in operating regions with low computational costs. Specifically, we propose the Task-wise Early Stopping and Loss Aggregation (TESLA) algorithm, which is showed in our 3-layer multilayer perceptron on MNIST that achieves 94.7% accuracy on average, and especially outperforms the original IDP by 32% when only 10% of dot products we used. We further introduce trainable profile coefficients, with which TESLA further improves the accuracy to 95.5% without specifying coefficients in advance. We also apply TESLA to the VGG-16 model on CIFAR-10 and it achieves 80% accuracy using only 20% of dot products, where the original IDP does not work. Finally, we visualize the learned representations at different dot product percentages by class activation map and show that, by applying TESLA, the learned representations can adapt over a wide range of operation regions.","pdf":"/pdf/bd6b4dc3c6962b705863b934a22da7857dd65171.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|tesla_taskwise_early_stopping_and_loss_aggregation_for_dynamic_neural_network_inference","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018tesla:,          \ntitle={TESLA: Task-wise Early Stopping And Loss Aggregation for Dynamic Neural Network Inference},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper735/Authors"],"keywords":[]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509137312930,"tcdate":1509133757185,"number":734,"cdate":1509133757185,"id":"SySpa-Z0Z","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"SySpa-Z0Z","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"From Information Bottleneck To Activation Norm Penalty","abstract":"Many regularization methods have been proposed to prevent overfitting in neural networks.

While CNNs are particularly well-suited for capturing a proper hierarchy of concepts from real-world images, they are limited to domains where data is abundant. Recent attempts have looked into mitigating this data scarcity problem by casting their original single-task problem into a new multi-task learning (MTL) problem. The main goal of this inductive transfer mechanism is to leverage domain-specific information from related tasks, in order to improve generalization on the main task. While recent results in the deep learning (DL) community have shown the promising potential of training task-specific CNNs in a soft parameter sharing framework, integrating the recent DL advances for improving knowledge sharing is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose the Deep Collaboration Network (DCNet), a novel approach for connecting task-specific CNNs in a MTL framework. We define connectivity in terms of two distinct non-linear transformation blocks. One aggregates task-specific features into global features, while the other merges back the global features with each task-specific network. Based on the observation that task relevance depends on depth, our transformation blocks use skip connections as suggested by residual network approaches, to more easily deactivate unrelated task-dependent features. To validate our approach, we employed facial landmark detection (FLD) datasets as they are readily amenable to MTL, given the number of tasks they include. Experimental results show that we can achieve up to 24.31% relative improvement in landmark failure rate over other state-of-the-art MTL approaches. We finally perform an ablation study showing that our approach effectively allows knowledge sharing, by leveraging domain-specific features at particular depths from tasks that we know are related.","pdf":"/pdf/e2ce2f1a8545df021b3fee8845c65b4cdc86ca12.pdf","TL;DR":"We propose a novel approach for connecting task-specific networks in a multi-task learning setting based on recent residual network advances.","paperhash":"anonymous|multitask_learning_by_deep_collaboration_and_application_in_facial_landmark_detection","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018multi-task,          \ntitle={Multi-Task Learning by Deep Collaboration and Application in Facial Landmark Detection},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper729/Authors"],"keywords":["multi-task learning","soft parameter sharing","facial landmark detection"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509134987057,"tcdate":1509133576217,"number":728,"cdate":1509133576217,"id":"SJgf6Z-0W","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"SJgf6Z-0W","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Predicting Multiple Actions for Stochastic Continuous Control","abstract":"We introduce a new approach to estimate continuous actions using actor-critic algorithms for reinforcement learning problems.

We also estimate the dimension of the deep manifold based on the tangent space for each of the maxpooling layers. Our results show that the dimensions of different categories are close to each other and decline quickly along the convolutional layers and fully connected layers.

However, its sample efficiency is often impractically large for solving challenging real-world problems, even for off-policy algorithms such as Q-learning. A limiting factor in classic model-free RL is that the learning signal consists only of scalar rewards, ignoring much of the rich information contained in state transition tuples. Model-based RL uses this information, by training a predictive model, but often does not achieve the same asymptotic performance as model-free RL due to model bias. We introduce temporal difference models (TDMs), a family of goal-conditioned value functions that unify model-free learning and model-based learning. TDMs combine the benefits of model-free and model-based RL: they leverage the rich information in state transitions to learn very efficiently, while still attaining asymptotic performance that exceeds that of direct model-based RL methods.

Predictive State Recurrent Neural Networks (PSRNNs) (Downey et al.) are a state-of-the-art approach for modeling time-series data which combine the benefits of probabilistic filters and Recurrent Neural Networks into a single model. PSRNNs leverage the concept of Hilbert Space Embeddings of distributions (Smola et al.) to embed predictive states into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, then estimate, predict, and update these embedded states using Kernel Bayes Rule. Practical implementations of PSRNNs are made possible by the machinery of Random Features, where input features are mapped into a new space where dot products approximate the kernel well. Unfortunately PSRNNs often require a large number of RFs to obtain good results, resulting in large models which are slow to execute and slow to train. Orthogonal Random Features (ORFs) (Choromanski et al.) is an improvement on RFs which has been shown to decrease the number of RFs required for pointwise kernel approximation. Unfortunately, it is not clear that ORFs can be applied to PSRNNs, as PSRNNs rely on Kernel Ridge Regression as a core component of their learning algorithm, and the theoretical guarantees of ORF do not apply in this setting. In this paper, we extend the theory of ORFs to Kernel Ridge Regression and show that ORFs can be used to obtain Orthogonal PSRNNs (OPSRNNs), which are smaller and faster than PSRNNs. In particular, we show that OPSRNN models clearly outperform LSTMs and furthermore, can achieve accuracy similar to PSRNNs with an order of magnitude smaller number of features needed.","pdf":"/pdf/2df2fcc3a0ad6f934834ac35f09d5a319d7484ea.pdf","TL;DR":"Improving Predictive State Recurrent Neural Networks via Orthogonal Random Features","paperhash":"anonymous|initialization_matters_orthogonal_predictive_state_recurrent_neural_networks","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018initialization,          \ntitle={Initialization matters: Orthogonal Predictive State Recurrent Neural Networks},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper721/Authors"],"keywords":["recurrent neural networks","orthogonal random features","predictive state representations"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509137923099,"tcdate":1509133475150,"number":720,"cdate":1509133475150,"id":"Hksj2WWAW","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"Hksj2WWAW","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Combining Symbolic Expressions and Black-box Function Evaluations in Neural Programs","abstract":"Neural programming involves training neural networks to learn programs from data.

In our theoretical analysis of the IWAE objective we derive asymptotic bias and variance expressions. Based on this analysis we develop jackknife variational inference (JVI),\na family of bias-reduced estimators reducing the bias to $O(K^{-(m+1)})$ for any given m < K while retaining computational efficiency. Finally, we demonstrate that JVI leads to improved evidence estimates in variational autoencoders. We also report first results on applying JVI to learning variational autoencoders.","pdf":"/pdf/b72e18f808fc5439ccff562587663dd9ffa21eac.pdf","TL;DR":"Variational inference is biased, let's debias it.","paperhash":"anonymous|debiasing_evidence_approximations_on_importanceweighted_autoencoders_and_jackknife_variational_inference","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018debiasing,          \ntitle={Debiasing Evidence Approximations: On Importance-weighted Autoencoders and Jackknife Variational Inference},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper713/Authors"],"keywords":["variational inference","approximate inference","generative models"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509137684108,"tcdate":1509133120802,"number":712,"cdate":1509133120802,"id":"H1tSsb-AW","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"H1tSsb-AW","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Variance Reduction for Policy Gradient Methods with Action-Dependent Baselines","abstract":"Policy gradient methods have enjoyed success in deep reinforcement learning but suffer from high variance of gradient estimates.

However, in this paper, we show how feedforward deep networks exhibit a low-rank derivative structure.  This low-rank structure makes it possible to use second-order information without needing approximations and without incurring a significantly greater computational cost than gradient descent.  To demonstrate this capability, we implement Cubic Regularization (CR) on a feedforward deep network with stochastic gradient descent and two of its variants.  There, we use CR to calculate learning rates on a per-iteration basis while training on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.  CR proved particularly successful in escaping plateau regions of the objective function.

Experiments on standard benchmark image datasets demonstrate clear visual improvements in the quality of the generated samples and exhibit more meaningful interpolation paths.","pdf":"/pdf/6982e7e20cdda42f5ba20b83df32e9e9e03dc526.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|semantic_interpolation_in_implicit_models","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018semantic,          \ntitle={Semantic Interpolation in Implicit Models},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper700/Authors"],"keywords":["Deep Generative Models","GANs"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509139052822,"tcdate":1509132429987,"number":699,"cdate":1509132429987,"id":"SyL9u-WA-","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"SyL9u-WA-","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Stabilizing Gradients for Deep Neural Networks via Efficient SVD Parameterization","abstract":"Vanishing and exploding gradients are two of the main obstacles in training deep neural networks, especially in capturing long range dependencies in recurrent neural networks (RNNs). In this paper, we present an efficient parametrization of the transition matrix of an RNN that allows us to stabilize the gradients that arise in its training. Specifically, we parameterize the transition matrix by its singular value decomposition (SVD), which allows us to explicitly track and control its singular values. We attain efficiency by using tools that are common in numerical linear algebra, namely Householder reflectors for representing the orthogonal matrices that arise in the SVD. By explicitly controlling the singular values, our proposed svdRNN method allows us to easily solve the exploding gradient problem and we observe that it empirically solves the vanishing gradient issue to a large extent. We note that the SVD parameterization can be used for any rectangular weight matrix, hence it can be easily extended to any deep neural network, such as a multi-layer perceptron. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our parameterization does not lose any expressive power, and show how it potentially makes the optimization process easier. Our extensive  experimental results also demonstrate that the proposed framework converges faster, and has good generalization, especially when the depth is large. \n","pdf":"/pdf/7865267a324dfcd873d101339d8b50569aae3c89.pdf","TL;DR":"To solve the gradient vanishing/exploding problems, we proprose an efficient parametrization of the transition matrix of RNN that loses no expressive power, converges faster and has good generalization.","paperhash":"anonymous|stabilizing_gradients_for_deep_neural_networks_via_efficient_svd_parameterization","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018stabilizing,          \ntitle={Stabilizing Gradients for Deep Neural Networks via Efficient SVD Parameterization},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper699/Authors"],"keywords":["Recurrent Neural Network","Vanishing Gradient","Exploding Gradient","Linear Algebra","Householder Reflections"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509138898661,"tcdate":1509132399107,"number":698,"cdate":1509132399107,"id":"S1vuO-bCW","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"S1vuO-bCW","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Leave no Trace: Learning to Reset for Safe and Autonomous Reinforcement Learning","abstract":"Deep reinforcement learning algorithms can learn complex behavioral skills, but real-world application of these methods requires a considerable amount of experience to be collected by the agent. In practical settings, such as robotics, this involves repeatedly attempting a task, resetting the environment between each attempt. However, not all tasks are easily or automatically reversible. In practice, this learning process requires considerable human intervention. In this work, we propose an autonomous method for safe and efficient reinforcement learning that simultaneously learns a forward and backward policy, with the backward policy resetting the environment for a subsequent attempt. By learning a value function for the backward policy, we can automatically determine when the forward policy is about to enter a non-reversible state, providing for uncertainty-aware safety aborts.

One example is the estimation of treatment effects from observational data, where a subtask is to predict the effect of a treatment on subjects that are systematically different from those who received the treatment in the data. A related kind of distributional shift appears in unsupervised domain adaptation, where we are tasked with generalizing to a distribution of inputs that is different from the one in which we observe labels. We pose both of these problems as prediction under a shift in design. Popular methods for overcoming distributional shift are often heuristic or rely on assumptions that are rarely true in practice, such as having a well-specified model or knowing the policy that gave rise to the observed data. Other methods are hindered by their need for a pre-specified metric for comparing observations, or by poor asymptotic properties.

In addition to the text data itself, we often have additional covariates associated with individual documents in the corpus---e.g. the demographic of the author, time and venue of publication, etc.---and we would like the embedding to naturally capture the information of the covariates. In this paper, we propose a new tensor decomposition model for word embeddings with covariates. Our model jointly learns a \\emph{base} embedding for all the words as well as a weighted diagonal transformation to model how each covariate modifies the base embedding. To obtain the specific embedding for a particular author or venue, for example, we can then simply multiply the base embedding by the transformation matrix associated with that time or venue. The main advantages of our approach is data efficiency and interpretability of the covariate transformation matrix. Our experiments demonstrate that our joint model learns substantially better embeddings conditioned on each covariate compared to the standard approach of learning a separate embedding for each covariate using only the relevant subset of data. Furthermore, our model encourages the embeddings to be ``topic-aligned'' in the sense that the dimensions have specific independent meanings. This allows our covariate-specific embeddings to be compared by topic, enabling downstream differential analysis. We empirically evaluate the benefits of our algorithm on several datasets, and demonstrate how it can be used to address many natural questions about the effects of covariates.","pdf":"/pdf/e3c572fcde3b81904429fd30686d913ef86bd5a2.pdf","TL;DR":"Using the same embedding across covariates doesn't make sense, we show that a tensor decomposition algorithm learns sparse covariate-specific embeddings and naturally separable topics jointly and data-efficiently.","paperhash":"anonymous|learning_covariatespecific_embeddings_with_tensor_decompositions","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018learning,          \ntitle={Learning Covariate-Specific Embeddings with Tensor Decompositions},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper680/Authors"],"keywords":["Word embedding","tensor decomposition"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509138633553,"tcdate":1509131880292,"number":679,"cdate":1509131880292,"id":"rkgOLb-0W","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"rkgOLb-0W","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Neural Language Modeling by Jointly Learning Syntax and Lexicon","abstract":"We propose a neural language model capable of unsupervised syntactic structure induction.

Although previous approaches based on dimensionality reduction followed by density estimation have made fruitful progress, they mainly suffer from decoupled model learning with inconsistent optimization goals and incapability of preserving essential information in the low-dimensional space. In this paper, we present a Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model (DAGMM) for unsupervised anomaly detection. Our model utilizes a deep autoencoder to generate a low-dimensional representation and reconstruction error for each input data point, which is further fed into a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Instead of using decoupled two-stage training and the standard Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, DAGMM jointly optimizes the parameters of the deep autoencoder and the mixture model simultaneously in an end-to-end fashion, leveraging a separate estimation network to facilitate the parameter learning of the mixture model. The joint optimization, which well balances autoencoding reconstruction, density estimation of latent representation, and regularization, helps the autoencoder escape from less attractive local optima and further reduce reconstruction errors, avoiding the need of pre-training. Experimental results on several public benchmark datasets show that, DAGMM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques, and achieves up to 14% improvement based on the standard F1 score.","pdf":"/pdf/805b7f64d746b79938780ebd29379996e5152c2d.pdf","TL;DR":"An end-to-end trained deep neural network that leverages Gaussian Mixture Modeling to perform density estimation and unsupervised anomaly detection in a low-dimensional space learned by deep autoencoder.","paperhash":"anonymous|deep_autoencoding_gaussian_mixture_model_for_unsupervised_anomaly_detection","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018deep,          \ntitle={Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper672/Authors"],"keywords":["Density estimation","unsupervised anomaly detection","high-dimensional data","Deep autoencoder","Gaussian mixture modeling","latent low-dimensional space"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509136575849,"tcdate":1509131571693,"number":671,"cdate":1509131571693,"id":"By3VrbbAb","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"By3VrbbAb","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Realtime query completion via deep language models","abstract":"Search engine users nowadays heavily depend on query completion and correction to shape their queries.

Such a parametrization is unable to represent matrices with negative one eigenvalues, but this limitation is overcome by scaling the recurrent weight matrix by a diagonal matrix consisting of ones and negative ones.  The proposed training scheme involves a straightforward gradient calculation and update step. In several experiments, the proposed scaled Cayley orthogonal recurrent neural network (scoRNN) achieves superior results with fewer trainable parameters than other unitary RNNs.","pdf":"/pdf/5012d24079fd0628df63891eb8af9d3cd005d119.pdf","TL;DR":"A novel approach to maintain orthogonal recurrent weight matrices in a RNN.","paperhash":"anonymous|orthogonal_recurrent_neural_networks_with_scaled_cayley_transform","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018orthogonal,          \ntitle={Orthogonal Recurrent Neural Networks with Scaled Cayley Transform},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper664/Authors"],"keywords":["recurrent neural networks","vanishing gradients","exploding gradients","orthogonal","unitary","long term dependencies","uRNN"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509138604636,"tcdate":1509131145746,"number":663,"cdate":1509131145746,"id":"HkGcX--0-","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"HkGcX--0-","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Auxiliary Guided Autoregressive Variational Autoencoders","abstract":"Generative modeling of high-dimensional data is a key problem in machine learning.

In this paper, we undertake the first systematic survey of when local codes emerge in a feed-forward neural network (used as a model for a single layer of a deep network), using generated input and output data with known qualities. We find that the number of local codes that emerge from a NN follows a well-defined distribution across the number of hidden layer neurons, with a peak determined by the size of input data, number of examples presented and the sparsity of input data. Using a 1-HOT output code drastically decreases the number of local codes on the hidden layer, suggesting that localist encoding will be found at the deeper levels of a deep neural network. The number of emergent local codes increases with the percentage of dropout applied to the hidden layer, suggesting that the localist encoding may offer a resilience to noisy networks. This data suggests that localist coding can emerge from PDP networks, and thus might be relevant to the functioning of deep networks and the brain, and that psychological models based on local codes should not be dismissed out of hand.","pdf":"/pdf/0a30e7b6502f8fcff17b5672f36270197cdc5893.pdf","TL;DR":"Local codes have been found in feed-forward neural networks","paperhash":"anonymous|when_and_where_do_feedforward_neural_networks_learn_localist_representations","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018when,          \ntitle={When and where do feed-forward neural networks learn localist representations?},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper659/Authors"],"keywords":["localist","pdp","neural network","representation","psychology","cognition"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509134183915,"tcdate":1509130742112,"number":658,"cdate":1509130742112,"id":"BJRxfZbAW","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"BJRxfZbAW","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"The Context-Aware Learner","abstract":"One important aspect of generalization in machine learning involves reasoning about previously seen data in new settings.

Conventional model compression methods attempt to address this problem by modifying the architecture manually or using pre-defined heuristics. Since the space of all reduced architectures is very large, modifying the architecture of a deep neural network in this way is a difficult task. In this paper, we tackle this issue by introducing a principled method for learning reduced network architectures in a data-driven way using reinforcement learning. Our approach takes a larger 'teacher' network as input and outputs a compressed 'student' network derived from the 'teacher' network. In the first stage of our method, a recurrent policy network aggressively removes layers from the large 'teacher' model. In the second stage, another  recurrent policy network carefully reduces the size of each remaining layer. The resulting network is then evaluated to obtain a reward -- a score based on the accuracy and compression of the network. Our approach uses this reward signal with policy gradients to train the policies to find a locally optimal student network. Our experiments show that we can achieve compression rates of more than 10x for models such as ResNet-34 while maintaining similar performance to the input 'teacher' network. We also present a valuable transfer learning result which shows that policies which are pre-trained on smaller 'teacher' networks can be used to rapidly speed up training on larger 'teacher' networks.","pdf":"/pdf/9dd5216601d9d515e2777623a6e5e129230bae69.pdf","TL;DR":"A novel reinforcement learning based approach to compress deep neural networks with knowledge distillation","paperhash":"anonymous|n2n_learning_network_to_network_compression_via_policy_gradient_reinforcement_learning","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018n2n,          \ntitle={N2N learning: Network to Network Compression via Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper653/Authors"],"keywords":["Deep learning","Neural networks","Model compression"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509130549389,"tcdate":1509130549158,"number":652,"cdate":1509130549158,"id":"HypNZW-Rb","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"HypNZW-Rb","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Target-Aware Memory Networks for Aspect Sentiment Classification","abstract":"Memory networks with external memories and the attention mechanism have been used in numerous applications and achieved superior results.

For example, given two target aspects (which are product features) resolution and price, “higher resolution” and “lower price” express positive opinions while “higher price” and “lower resolution” express negative opinions. We observe that the same word higher (or lower) can indicate different sentiments for different target aspects.

We propose a new generalization bound for domain adaptation when there are multiple source domains with labeled instances and one target domain with unlabeled instances. Compared with existing bounds, the new bound does not require expert knowledge about the target distribution, nor the optimal combination rule for multisource domains. Interestingly, our theory also leads to an efficient learning strategy using adversarial neural networks: we show how to interpret it as learning feature representations that are invariant to the multiple domain shifts while still being discriminative for the learning task. To this end, we propose two models, both of which we call multisource domain adversarial networks (MDANs): the first model optimizes directly our bound, while the second model is a smoothed approximation of the first one, leading to a more data-efficient and task-adaptive model. The optimization tasks of both models are minimax saddle point problems that can be optimized by adversarial training. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MDANs, we conduct extensive experiments showing superior adaptation performance on three real-world datasets: sentiment analysis, digit classification, and vehicle counting. \n","pdf":"/pdf/89ab463ecc6682929a6f2460adf56b078d47a425.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|multiple_source_domain_adaptation_with_adversarial_learning","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018multiple,          \ntitle={Multiple Source Domain Adaptation with Adversarial Learning},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper651/Authors"],"keywords":["adversarial learning","domain adaptation"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509131935830,"tcdate":1509130540849,"number":650,"cdate":1509130540849,"id":"rkHVZWZAZ","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"rkHVZWZAZ","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"The Reactor: A fast and sample-efficient Actor-Critic agent for  Reinforcement Learning","abstract":"In this work we present a new agent architecture, called Reactor, which combines multiple algorithmic and architectural contributions to produce an agent with higher sample-efficiency than Prioritized Dueling DQN (Wang et al., 2016) and Categorical DQN (Bellemare et al., 2017), while giving better run-time performance than A3C (Mnih et al., 2016).

The exploration of the model design space is often made by a human expert, and optimized using a combination of grid search and search heuristics over a large space of possible choices. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a Reinforcement Learning approach that has been proposed to automate architecture design. NAS has been successfully applied to generate Neural Networks that rival the best human-designed architectures. However, NAS requires sampling, constructing, and training hundreds to thousands of models to achieve well-performing architectures. This procedure needs to be executed from scratch for each new task. The application of NAS to a wide set of tasks currently lacks a way to transfer generalizable knowledge across tasks.\nIn this paper, we present the Multitask Neural Model Search (MNMS) controller. Our goal is to learn a generalizable framework that can condition model construction on successful model searches for previously seen tasks, thus significantly speeding up the search for new tasks. We demonstrate that MNMS can conduct an automated architecture search for multiple tasks simultaneously while still learning well-performing, specialized models for each task. We then show that pre-trained MNMS controllers can transfer learning to new tasks. By leveraging knowledge from previous searches, we find that pre-trained MNMS models start from a better location in the search space and reduce search time on unseen tasks, while still discovering models that outperform published human-designed models.","pdf":"/pdf/60d3f0f5b676332d9b390971e9afca9a17cad56e.pdf","TL;DR":"We present Multitask Neural Model Search, a Meta-learner that can design models for multiple tasks simultaneously and transfer learning to unseen tasks.","paperhash":"anonymous|transfer_learning_to_learn_with_multitask_neural_model_search","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018transfer,          \ntitle={Transfer Learning to Learn with Multitask Neural Model Search},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper649/Authors"],"keywords":["Learning to Learn","Meta learning","Reinforcement learning","Transfer learning"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509130464138,"tcdate":1509130462941,"number":648,"cdate":1509130462941,"id":"H1Dy---0Z","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"H1Dy---0Z","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Distributed Prioritized Experience Replay","abstract":"We propose a distributed architecture for deep reinforcement learning at scale, that enables agents to learn effectively from orders of magnitude more data than previously possible.

Sparsity is a technique to reduce compute and memory requirements of deep learning models. Sparse RNNs are easier to deploy on devices and high-end server processors. Even though sparse operations need less compute and memory relative to their dense counterparts, the speed-up observed by using sparse operations is less than expected on different hardware platforms. In order to address this issue, we investigate two different approaches to induce block sparsity in RNNs: pruning blocks of weights in a layer and using group lasso regularization to create blocks of weights with zeros. Using these techniques, we demonstrate that we can create block-sparse RNNs with sparsity ranging from 80% to 90% with small loss in accuracy. This allows us to reduce the model size by roughly 10x.

We introduce Multi-Agent Coordinated Exploration (MACE), a deep reinforcement learning approach to learn expressive multi-agent policies that are both statistically and computationally efficient. MACE implements a form of multi-agent coordination during exploration and execution, by using a hierarchical stochastic multi-agent policy class that encodes flexible structure between individual policies. In this way, MACE preserves expressivity along with low sample complexity. In order to make learning tractable, we derive a joint learning and exploration strategy by combining hierarchical variational inference with actor-critic learning. The benefits of our learning approach are that 1) it is principled, 2) simple to implement and 3) easily scalable to settings with many agents. We demonstrate empirically that MACE can more efficiently learn optimal policies in challenging multi-agent games with a large number (∼ 20) of agents, compared to conventional baselines. Moreover, we show that our hierarchical structure leads to meaningful agent coordination.","pdf":"/pdf/fe2ee9b4715f094c046ea8a6df7f02439a38cb96.pdf","TL;DR":"Explore more efficiently in deep multi-agent reinforcement learning through agent coordination with structured policies.","paperhash":"anonymous|mace_structured_exploration_via_deep_hierarchical_coordination","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018mace:,          \ntitle={MACE: Structured Exploration via Deep Hierarchical Coordination},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper631/Authors"],"keywords":["Multi-agent Learning","Deep Reinforcement Learning","Structured Variational Inference","Multi-agent Coordination"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509288212096,"tcdate":1509129630651,"number":630,"cdate":1509129630651,"id":"rkDj6gW0-","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"rkDj6gW0-","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Dynamically Learning the Learning Rates:  Online Hyperparameter Optimization","abstract":"Hyperparameter tuning is arguably the most important ingredient for obtaining state of art performance in deep networks.

In contrast to this body of research, we propose to treat active learning algorithm design as a meta-learning problem and learn the best criterion from data. We model an active learning algorithm as a deep neural network that inputs the base learner state and the unlabelled point set and predicts the best point to annotate next. Training this active query policy network with reinforcement learning, produces the best non-myopic policy for a given dataset. The key challenge in achieving a general solution to AL then becomes that of learner generalisation, particularly across heterogeneous datasets. We propose a multi-task dataset-embedding approach that allows dataset-agnostic active learners to be trained.

Though WGAN is indeed more stable than previous GANs, it takes much more iterations and time to train. This is because the ways to ensure Lipschitz condition in WGAN (such as weight-clipping) significantly limit the capacity of the network. In this paper, we argue that it is beneficial to ensure Lipschitz condition as well as maintain sufficient capacity and expressiveness of the network. To facilitate this, we develop both theoretical and practical building blocks, using which one can construct different neural networks using a large range of metrics, as well as ensure Lipschitz condition and sufficient capacity of the networks. Using the proposed building blocks, and a special choice of a metric called Dudley metric, we propose Dudley GAN that outperforms the state of the arts in both convergence and sample quality.

How to interpret black-box predictors is thus an important and active area of research.  A fundamental question is: how much can we trust the interpretation itself? In this paper, we show that interpretation of deep learning predictions is extremely fragile in the following sense:  two perceptively indistinguishable inputs with the same predicted label can be assigned very different interpretations. We systematically characterize the fragility of several widely-used feature-importance interpretation methods (saliency maps, relevance propagation, and DeepLIFT) on ImageNet and CIFAR-10. Our experiments show that even small random perturbation can change the feature importance and new systematic perturbations can lead to dramatically different interpretations without changing the label. We extend these results to show that interpretations based on exemplars (e.g. influence functions) are similarly fragile. Our analysis of the geometry of the Hessian matrix gives insight on why fragility could be a fundamental challenge to the current interpretation approaches.","pdf":"/pdf/2a78460adc318589991dd9b17b5139c956ff5d59.pdf","TL;DR":"Can we trust a neural network's explanation for its prediction?

A naive application of convolutional networks to a planar projection of the spherical signal is destined to fail, because the space-varying distortions introduced by such a projection will make translational weight sharing ineffective.\nIn this paper we introduce the building blocks for contructing spherical CNNs.

Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown outstanding image classification performance even on tasks with small-scale training sets. The performance can be attributed to transfer learning through CNNs’ ability to learn rich mid-level image representations. However, no prior work exists on general transfer learning for time-series forecasting. In this paper, motivated by recent success of transfer learning in CNN model and image-related tasks, we for the first time show how time-series representations learned with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) on large-scale datasets can be efficiently transferred to other time-series forecasting tasks with limited amount of training data. We also validate that despite differences in time-series statistics and tasks in the datasets, the transferred representation leads to significantly improved forecasting results outperforming majority of the best time-series methods on the public M3 and other datasets. Our online universal forecasting tool, DeepCast, will leverage transfer learning to provide accurate forecasts for a diverse set of time series where classical methods were computationally infeasible or inapplicable due to short training history.","pdf":"/pdf/916271b1bbe826983fa147b74f7717ee8de4a36e.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|deepcast_universal_timeseries_forecaster","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018deepcast:,          \ntitle={DEEPCAST: UNIVERSAL TIME-SERIES FORECASTER},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper610/Authors"],"keywords":[]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509136973391,"tcdate":1509128502870,"number":609,"cdate":1509128502870,"id":"HJ1HFlZAb","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"HJ1HFlZAb","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Evaluation of generative networks through their data augmentation capacity","abstract":"Generative networks are known to be difficult to assess. Recent works on generative models, especially on generative adversarial networks, produce nice samples of varied categories of images.

A good generator should generate data which contain meaningful and varied information and that fit the distribution of a dataset. This paper presents a new method to assess a generator. Our approach is based on training a classifier with a mixture of real and generated samples. We train a generative model over a labeled training set, then we use this generative model to sample new data points that we mix with the original training data. This mixture of real and generated data is thus used to train a classifier which is afterwards tested on a given labeled test dataset. We compare this result with the score of the same classifier trained on the real training data mixed with noise. By computing the classifier's accuracy with different ratios of samples from both distributions (real and generated) we are able to estimate if the generator successfully fits and is able to generalize the distribution of the dataset. Our experiments compare the result of different generators from the VAE and GAN framework on MNIST and fashion MNIST dataset.","pdf":"/pdf/2ceecb2a4871054d9ca9c22218ecd193e661bd97.pdf","TL;DR":"Evaluating generative networks through their data augmentation capacity on discrimative models.","paperhash":"anonymous|evaluation_of_generative_networks_through_their_data_augmentation_capacity","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018evaluation,          \ntitle={Evaluation of generative networks through their data augmentation capacity},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper609/Authors"],"keywords":["Generative models","Evaluation of generative models","Data Augmentation"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509128426981,"tcdate":1509128426755,"number":608,"cdate":1509128426755,"id":"r17lFgZ0Z","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"r17lFgZ0Z","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Relevance of Unsupervised Metrics in Task-Oriented Dialogue for Evaluating Natural Language Generation","abstract":"Automated metrics such as BLEU are widely used in the machine translation literature.

Task-oriented dialogue responses are expressed on narrower domains and exhibit lower diversity. It is thus reasonable to think that these automated metrics would correlate well with human judgment in the task-oriented setting where the generation task consists of translating dialogue acts into a sentence. We conduct an empirical study to confirm whether this is the case. Our findings indicate that these automated metrics have stronger correlation with human judgments in the task-oriented setting compared to what has been observed in the non task-oriented setting.

As of yet, none of these proposals have been rigorously evaluated on tasks where BP-guided deep learning has proved critical, or in architectures more structured than simple fully-connected networks. Here we present the first results on scaling up a biologically motivated model of deep learning to datasets which need deep networks with  appropriate architectures to achieve good performance.

For ImageNet we find that both DTP and our algorithm perform significantly worse than BP, opening questions about whether different architectures or algorithms are required to scale these approaches.

In particular, in the context of deep learning, we empirically show that the spectrum of the Hessian is composed of two parts: (1) the bulk centered near zero, (2) and outliers away from the bulk. We present numerical evidence and mathematical justifications to the following conjectures laid out by Sagun et. al. (2016): Fixing data, increasing the number of parameters merely scales the bulk of the spectrum; fixing the dimension and changing the data (for instance adding more clusters or making the data less separable) only affects the outliers. We believe that our observations have striking implications for non-convex optimization in high dimensions. First, the *flatness* of such landscapes (which can be measured by the singularity of the Hessian) implies that classical notions of basins of attraction may be quite misleading. And that the discussion of wide/narrow basins may be in need of a new perspective around over-parametrization and redundancy that are able to create *large* connected components at the bottom of the landscape. Second, the dependence of small number of large eigenvalues to the data distribution can be linked to the spectrum of the covariance matrix of gradients of model outputs. With this in mind, we may reevaluate the connections within the data-architecture-algorithm framework of a model, hoping that it would shed light into the geometry of high-dimensional and non-convex spaces in modern applications. In particular, we present a case that links the two observations: small and large batch gradient descent appear to converge to different basins of attraction but we show that they are in fact connected through their flat region and so belong to the same basin.","pdf":"/pdf/7e8c0c57b6e380ebc7db896ad7b0a794db065a2d.pdf","TL;DR":"The loss surface is *very* degenerate, and there are no barriers between large batch and small batch solutions.","paperhash":"anonymous|empirical_analysis_of_the_hessian_of_overparametrized_neural_networks","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018empirical,          \ntitle={Empirical Analysis of the Hessian of Over-Parametrized Neural Networks},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper602/Authors"],"keywords":["Deep Learning","Over-parametrization","Hessian","Eigenvalues","Flat minima","Large batch Small batch"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509139093653,"tcdate":1509128087753,"number":601,"cdate":1509128087753,"id":"HyxjwgbRZ","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"HyxjwgbRZ","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Convergence rate of sign stochastic gradient descent for non-convex functions","abstract":"The sign stochastic gradient descent method (signSGD) utilizes only the sign of the stochastic gradient in its updates.

Multi-task learning (MTL) has been extensively explored in these studies to address challenges associated to high dimensionality and small cohort size. However, most existing MTL approaches are based on linear models and suffer from two major limitations: 1) they cannot explicitly consider upper/lower bounds in these clinical scores; 2) they lack the capability to capture complicated non-linear effects among the variables. In this paper, we propose the Subspace Network, an efficient deep modeling approach for non-linear multi-task censored regression. Each layer of the subspace network performs a multi-task censored regression to improve upon the predictions from the last layer via sketching a low-dimensional subspace to perform knowledge transfer among learning tasks. We show that under mild assumptions, for each layer the parametric subspace can be recovered using only one pass of training data. In addition, empirical results demonstrate that the proposed subspace network quickly picks up correct parameter subspaces, and outperforms state-of-the-arts in predicting neurodegenerative clinical scores using information in brain imaging.

A few methods have been proposed to compress gradient for efficient communication, but they either suffer a low compression ratio or significantly harm the resulting model accuracy, particularly when applied to convolutional neural networks. To address these issues, we propose a method to reduce the communication overhead of distributed deep learning. Our key observation is that gradient updates can be delayed until an unambiguous (high amplitude, low variance) gradient has been calculated. We also present an efficient algorithm to compute the variance and prove that it can be obtained with negligible additional cost. We experimentally show that our method can achieve very high compression ratio while maintaining the result model accuracy. We also analyze the efficiency using computation and communication cost models and provide the evidence that this method enables distributed deep learning for many scenarios with commodity environments.","pdf":"/pdf/d06ff7651ff54a171b7a0fdb38699d6fa1a9d841.pdf","TL;DR":"A new algorithm to reduce the communication overhead of distributed deep learning by distinguishing ‘unambiguous’ gradients.","paperhash":"anonymous|variancebased_gradient_compression_for_efficient_distributed_deep_learning","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018variance-based,          \ntitle={Variance-based Gradient Compression for Efficient Distributed Deep Learning},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper597/Authors"],"keywords":["distributed deep learning","gradient compression","collective communication","data parallel distributed sgd","image classification"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509127909661,"tcdate":1509127909457,"number":596,"cdate":1509127909457,"id":"Hk6kPgZA-","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"Hk6kPgZA-","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Certifiable Distributional Robustness with Principled Adversarial Training","abstract":"Neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples and researchers have proposed many heuristic attack and defense mechanisms.

SCAN learns concepts through fast symbol association, grounding them in disentangled visual primitives that are discovered in an unsupervised manner. Unlike state of the art multimodal generative model baselines, our approach requires very few pairings between symbols and images and makes no assumptions about the form of symbol representations. Once trained, SCAN is capable of multimodal bi-directional inference, generating a diverse set of image samples from symbolic descriptions and vice versa. It also allows for traversal and manipulation of the implicit hierarchy of visual concepts through symbolic instructions and learnt logical recombination operations. Such manipulations enable SCAN to break away from its training data distribution and imagine novel visual concepts through symbolically instructed recombination of previously learnt concepts.","pdf":"/pdf/019d3d150db4cc7483e5b168eab91c35ab4214dd.pdf","TL;DR":"We present a neural variational model for learning language-guided compositional visual concepts.","paperhash":"anonymous|scan_learning_hierarchical_compositional_visual_concepts","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018scan:,          \ntitle={SCAN: Learning Hierarchical Compositional Visual Concepts},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper593/Authors"],"keywords":["grounded visual concepts","compositional representation","concept hierarchy","disentangling","beta-VAE","variational autoencoder","deep learning","generative model"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509142112543,"tcdate":1509127803175,"number":592,"cdate":1509127803175,"id":"HymYLebCb","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"HymYLebCb","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Network Signatures from Image Representation of Adjacency Matrices: Deep/Transfer Learning for Subgraph Classification","abstract":"We propose a novel subgraph image representation for classification of network fragments with the target being their parent networks.

A theoretical framework for measuring the complexity of compositions of functions is developed in order to show that it is reasonable to expect the minimal complexity mapping to be unique. The measured complexity used is directly related to the depth of the neural networks being learned and a semantically aligned mapping could then be captured simply by learning using architectures that are not much bigger than the minimal architecture.\n\nVarious predictions are made based on the hypothesis that semantic alignment can be captured by the minimal mapping.

Practitioners typically collect multiple labels per example and aggregate the results to mitigate noise (the classic crowdsourcing problem).

This raises two fundamental questions: (1) How can we best learn from noisy workers? (2) How should we allocate our labeling budget to maximize the performance of a classifier? We propose a new algorithm for jointly modeling labels and worker quality from noisy crowd-sourced data. The alternating minimization proceeds in rounds, estimating worker quality from disagreement with the current model and then updating the model by optimizing a loss function that accounts for the current estimate of worker quality. Unlike previous approaches, even with only one annotation per example, our algorithm can estimate worker quality. We establish a generalization error bound for models learned with our algorithm and establish theoretically that it's better to label many examples once (vs less multiply).

We report experiments providing strong evidence that hidden neurons behave like binary classifiers during training and testing. During training, analysis of the gradients reveals that a neuron separates two categories of inputs, which are impressively constant across training.

In this paper, we investigate theoretically how time limits could effectively be handled in each of the two cases. In the first one, we argue that the terminations due to time limits are in fact part of the environment, and propose to include a notion of the remaining time as part of the agent's input. In the second case, the time limits are not part of the environment and are only used to facilitate learning. We argue that such terminations should not be treated as environmental ones and propose a method, specific to value-based algorithms, that incorporates this insight by continuing to bootstrap at the end of each partial episode. To illustrate the significance of our proposals, we perform several experiments on a range of environments from simple few-state transition graphs to complex control tasks, including novel and standard benchmark domains.

Real-world events can be stochastic and unpredictable, and the high dimensionality and complexity of natural images requires the predictive model to build an intricate understanding of the natural world. Many existing methods tackle this problem by making simplifying assumptions about the environment. One common assumption is that the outcome is deterministic and there is only one plausible future. This can lead to low-quality predictions in real-world settings with stochastic dynamics. In this paper, we develop a stochastic variational video prediction (SV2P) method that predicts a different possible future for each sample of its latent variables. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first to provide effective stochastic multi-frame prediction for real-world video. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed method in predicting detailed future frames of videos on multiple real-world datasets, both action-free and action-conditioned. We find that our proposed method produces substantially improved video predictions when compared to the same model without stochasticity, and to other stochastic video prediction methods.

Using statistical hypothesis testing, we find that modern neural density models are surprisingly good at detecting imperceptible image perturbations. Based on this discovery, we devised PixelDefend, a new approach that purifies a maliciously perturbed image by moving it back towards the distribution seen in the training data. The purified image is then run through an unmodified classifier, making our method agnostic to both the classifier and the attacking method. As a result, PixelDefend can be used to protect already deployed models and be combined with other model-specific defenses.

In this work, we completely remove the need of parallel data and propose a novel method to train an NMT system in a completely unsupervised manner, relying on nothing but monolingual corpora. Our model builds upon the recent work on unsupervised embedding mappings, and consists of a slightly modified attentional encoder-decoder model that can be trained on monolingual corpora alone using a combination of denoising and backtranslation.

To make use of weak labels we introduce an autoencoder model and train it through constraints on image pairs and triplets.

However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: very high sample complexity and brittle convergence properties, which necessitate meticulous hyperparameter tuning. Both of these challenges severely limit the applicability of such methods to complex, real-world domains. In this paper, we propose soft actor-critic, an off-policy actor-critic deep RL algorithm based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, the actor aims to maximize expected reward while also maximizing entropy - that is, succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. Prior deep RL methods based on this framework have been formulated as either off-policy Q-learning, or on-policy policy gradient methods. By combining off-policy updates with a stable stochastic actor-critic formulation, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods.","pdf":"/pdf/24d324f7f6cfefa6133e22ef076688e73f8370d5.pdf","TL;DR":"We propose soft actor-critic, an off-policy actor-critic deep RL algorithm based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework.","paperhash":"anonymous|soft_actorcritic_offpolicy_maximum_entropy_deep_reinforcement_learning_with_a_stochastic_actor","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018soft,          \ntitle={Soft Actor-Critic: Off-Policy Maximum Entropy Deep Reinforcement Learning with a Stochastic Actor},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper551/Authors"],"keywords":["deep reinforcement learning","maximum entropy learning","stochastic actor-critic"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509132661488,"tcdate":1509126237976,"number":550,"cdate":1509126237976,"id":"HJLPel-CW","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"HJLPel-CW","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Language Style Transfer from Non-Parallel Text with Arbitrary Styles","abstract":"Language style transfer is the problem of migrating the content of a source sentence to a target style.

As a consequence, many classification tasks entail incomplete annotation and incorrect labels, while being built on a restricted amount of data. In order to handle the ambiguity and the label noise, the performance of machine learning models is usually assessed with top-$k$ error metrics rather than top-$1$. Theoretical results suggest that to minimize this error, various loss functions, including cross-entropy, are equally optimal choices of learning objectives in the limit of infinite data. However, the choice of loss function becomes crucial in the context of limited and noisy data. Besides, our empirical evidence suggests that the loss function must be smooth and non-sparse to work well with deep neural networks. Consequently, we introduce a family of smoothed loss functions that are suited to top-$k$ optimization via deep learning. The widely used cross-entropy is a special case of our family. Evaluating our smooth loss functions is computationally challenging: a na{\\\"i}ve algorithm would require $\\mathcal{O}(\\binom{C}{k})$ operations, where $C$ is the number of classes. Thanks to a connection to polynomial algebra and a divide-and-conquer approach, we provide an algorithm with a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(k C)$. Furthermore, we present a novel and error-bounded approximation to obtain fast and stable algorithms on GPUs with single floating point precision. We compare the performance of the cross-entropy loss and our margin-based losses in various regimes of noise and data size. Our investigation reveals that our loss provides on-par performance with cross-entropy for $k=1$, and is more robust to noise and overfitting for $k=5$.","pdf":"/pdf/69f52d077dcb96f952df52c7e262be399ac7b18e.pdf","TL;DR":"Smooth Loss Function for Top-k Error Minimization","paperhash":"anonymous|smooth_loss_functions_for_deep_topk_classification","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018smooth,          \ntitle={Smooth Loss Functions for Deep Top-k Classification},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper547/Authors"],"keywords":[]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509139203395,"tcdate":1509126110376,"number":546,"cdate":1509126110376,"id":"SyUkxxZ0b","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"SyUkxxZ0b","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Adversarial Spheres","abstract":"We introduce a simple synthetic task in order to study the phenomenon of adversarial examples.

Low precision numerics and model compression using knowledge distillation are popular techniques to lower both the compute requirements and memory footprint of these deployed models. In this paper, we study the combination of these two techniques and show that the performance of low precision networks can be significantly improved by using knowledge distillation techniques.

For the latter, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been considered. There has not been a rigorous evaluation regarding the relative importance of each component to different text-representation-based tasks; i.e., how important is the modeling capacity of word embeddings alone, relative to the added value of a compositional function? In this paper, we conduct an extensive comparative study between Simple Word Embeddings-based Models (SWEMs), with no compositional parameters, relative to employing word embeddings within RNN/CNN-based models. Surprisingly, SWEMs exhibit comparable or even superior performance in the majority of cases considered. Moreover, in a new SWEM setup, we propose to employ a max-pooling operation over the learned word-embedding matrix of a given sentence. This approach is demonstrated to extract complementary features relative to the averaging operation standard to SWEMs, while endowing our model with better interpretability. To further validate our observations, we examine the information utilized by different models to make predictions, revealing interesting properties of word embeddings.\n","pdf":"/pdf/37da28cc60c8140c01c67b33e01f770987a52ab6.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|on_the_use_of_word_embeddings_alone_to_represent_natural_language_sequences","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018on,          \ntitle={On the Use of Word Embeddings Alone to Represent Natural Language Sequences},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper535/Authors"],"keywords":["Natural Language Processing","Deep Learning"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509130207497,"tcdate":1509125633207,"number":534,"cdate":1509125633207,"id":"S1tWRJ-R-","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"S1tWRJ-R-","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Joint autoencoders: a flexible meta-learning framework","abstract":"The incorporation of prior knowledge into learning is essential in achieving good performance based on small noisy samples.

However,their method has limited applicability in practical settings as it requires annotation of structures (e.g., pose) at every time step.

Here, we use a variational autoencoder with an autoregressive decoder to learn a latent face space from a uniquely diverse dataset of portraits that control much of the variation irrelevant to human identity and appearance. Our method generates photorealistic portraits of fictive identities with a smooth, navigable latent space. We validate our model's alignment with human sensitivities by introducing a psychophysical Turing test for images, which humans mostly fail, a rare occurrence with any interesting generative image model.

Such behavior holds across multiple patterns of label noise, even when noisy labels are biased towards confusing classes. Further, we show how the required dataset size for successful training increases with higher label noise.

In practice, however, normalizing flows only consist of a finite number of deterministic transformations, and thus they possess no guarantee on the approximation accuracy. For density estimation, the generative adversarial network (GAN) has been advanced as an appealing model, due to its often excellent performance in generating samples. In this paper, we propose the concept of {\\em continuous-time flows} (CTFs), a family of diffusion-based methods that are able to asymptotically approach a target distribution. Distinct from normalizing flows and GANs, CTFs can be adopted to achieve the above two goals in one framework, with theoretical guarantees.

Unlike other generative models, the data distribution is learned via a game between a generator (the generative model) and a discriminator (a teacher providing training signal) that each minimize their own cost. GANs are designed to reach a Nash equilibrium at which each player cannot reduce their cost without changing the other players’ parameters. One useful approach for the theory of GANs is to show that a divergence between the training distribution and the model distribution obtains its minimum value at equilibrium. Several recent research directions have been motivated by the idea that this divergence is the primary guide for the learning process and that every step of learning should decrease the divergence. We show that this view is overly restrictive. During GAN training, the discriminator provides learning signal in situations where the gradients of the divergences between distributions would not be useful. We provide empirical counterexamples to the view of GAN training as divergence minimization. Specifically, we demonstrate that GANs are able to learn distributions in situations where the divergence minimization point of view predicts they would fail. We also show that gradient penalties motivated from the divergence minimization perspective are equally helpful when applied in other contexts in which the divergence minimization perspective does not predict they would be helpful. This contributes to a growing body of evidence that GAN training may be more usefully viewed as approaching Nash equilibria via trajectories that do not necessarily minimize a specific divergence at each step.","pdf":"/pdf/d02ce8b16b3cdb06e0ac79fb94b60f943eda86c9.pdf","TL;DR":"We find evidence that divergence minimization may not be an accurate characterization of GAN training.","paperhash":"anonymous|many_paths_to_equilibrium_gans_do_not_need_to_decrease_a_divergence_at_every_step","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018many,          \ntitle={Many Paths to Equilibrium: GANs Do Not Need to Decrease a Divergence At Every Step},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper520/Authors"],"keywords":["Deep learning","GAN"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509288693611,"tcdate":1509125250112,"number":519,"cdate":1509125250112,"id":"SJcKhk-Ab","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"SJcKhk-Ab","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Can recurrent neural networks warp time?","abstract":"Successful recurrent models such as long short-term memories (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) use \\emph{ad hoc} gating mechanisms.

In response, this paper introduces a collection of new methods for end-to-end learning in such models that approximate discrete maximum-weight matching using the continuous Sinkhorn operator.  Sinkhorn iteration is attractive because it functions as a simple, easy-to-implement analog of the softmax operator. With this, we can define the Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, an extension of the Gumbel-Softmax method (Jang et al. 2016, Maddison2016 et al. 2016) to distributions over latent matchings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by outperforming competitive baselines on a range of qualitatively different tasks: sorting numbers, solving jigsaw puzzles, and identifying neural signals in worms.

Alternatively, a more recent approach to meta-learning aims to acquire deep representations that can be effectively fine-tuned, via standard gradient descent, to new tasks. In this paper, we consider the meta-learning problem from the perspective of universality, formalizing the notion of learning algorithm approximation and comparing the expressive power of the aforementioned recurrent models to the more recent approaches that embed gradient descent into the meta-learner. In particular, we seek to answer the following question: does deep representation combined with standard gradient descent have sufficient capacity to approximate any learning algorithm?

In this work, we propose training a single generator simultaneously against an array of discriminators, each of which looks at a different random low-dimensional projection of the data. Individual discriminators, now provided with restricted views of the input, are unable to reject generated samples perfectly and continue to provide meaningful gradients to the generator throughout training.  Meanwhile, the generator learns to produce samples consistent with the full data distribution to satisfy all discriminators simultaneously. We  demonstrate the practical utility of this approach experimentally, and show that it is able to produce image samples with higher quality than traditional training with a single discriminator.","pdf":"/pdf/0b90bd9245065c9a07c30f188f6573b90cc7a05d.pdf","TL;DR":"Stable GAN training in high dimensions by using an array of discriminators, each with a low dimensional view of generated samples","paperhash":"anonymous|stabilizing_gan_training_with_multiple_random_projections","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018stabilizing,          \ntitle={Stabilizing GAN Training with Multiple Random Projections},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper512/Authors"],"keywords":["generative adversarial networks","stable training","low-dimensional projections","deep learning"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509137242328,"tcdate":1509124743538,"number":511,"cdate":1509124743538,"id":"BJk59JZ0b","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"BJk59JZ0b","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Guide Actor-Critic for Continuous Control","abstract":"Actor-critic methods solve reinforcement learning problems by updating a parameterized policy known as an actor in a direction that increases an estimate of the expected return known as a critic.

However, the success is limited at more knowledge intensive tasks such as QA from a big corpus. Existing end-to-end deep QA models (Miller et al., 2016; Weston et al., 2014) need to read the entire text after observing the question, and therefore their complexity in responding a question is linear in the text size. This is prohibitive for practical tasks such as QA from Wikipedia, a novel, or the Web. We propose to solve this scalability issue by using symbolic meaning representations, which can be indexed and retrieved efficiently with complexity that is independent of the text size. More specifically, we use sequence-to-sequence models to encode knowledge symbolically and generate programs to answer questions from the encoded knowledge. We apply our approach, called the N-Gram Machine (NGM), to the bAbI tasks (Weston et al., 2015) and a special version of them (“life-long bAbI”) which has stories of up to 10 million sentences. Our experiments show that NGM can successfully solve both of these tasks accurately and efficiently. Unlike fully differentiable memory models, NGM’s time complexity and answering quality are not affected by the story length. The whole system of NGM is trained end-to-end with REINFORCE (Williams, 1992). To avoid high variance in gradient estimation, which is typical in discrete latent variable models, we use beam search instead of sampling. To tackle the exponentially large search space, we use a stabilized auto-encoding objective and a structure tweak procedure to iteratively reduce and refine the search space.\n","pdf":"/pdf/7f9f452c0ff0c4689f378e2a767e89769fa02a0f.pdf","TL;DR":"We propose a framework that learns to encode knowledge symbolically and generate programs to reason about the encoded knowledge.","paperhash":"anonymous|learning_to_organize_knowledge_with_ngram_machines","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018learning,          \ntitle={LEARNING TO ORGANIZE KNOWLEDGE WITH N-GRAM MACHINES},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper510/Authors"],"keywords":["neuro-symbolic reasoning","information extraction","learn to search"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509124894158,"tcdate":1509124705622,"number":509,"cdate":1509124705622,"id":"ry5wc1bCW","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"ry5wc1bCW","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Causal Generative Neural Networks","abstract":"We introduce CGNN, a framework to learn functional causal models as generative neural networks.

A good teacher will select appropriate teaching materials, impact suitable methodologies, and set up targeted examinations, according to the learning behaviors of the students. In the field of artificial intelligence, however, one has largely overlooked the role of teaching, and pays most attention to machine \\emph{learning}. In this paper, we argue that equal attention, if not more, should be paid to teaching, and furthermore, an optimization framework (instead of heuristics) should be used to obtain good teaching strategies. We call this approach ``learning to teach''. In the approach, two intelligent agents interact with each other: a student model (which corresponds to the learner in traditional machine learning algorithms), and a teacher model (which determines the appropriate data, loss function, and hypothesis space to facilitate the training of the student model). The teacher model leverages the feedback from the student model to optimize its own teaching strategies by means of reinforcement learning, so as to achieve teacher-student co-evolution. To demonstrate the practical value of our proposed approach, we take the training of deep neural networks (DNN) as an example, and show that by using the learning-to-teach techniques, we are able to use much less training data and fewer iterations to achieve almost the same accuracy for different kinds of DNN models (e.g., multi-layer perceptron, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks) under various machine learning tasks (e.g., image classification and text understanding).","pdf":"/pdf/e00bf6dcd532d2ed60258c142ce57507bf26e8b1.pdf","TL;DR":"We propose and verify the effectiveness of learning to teach, a new framework to automatically guide machine learning process.","paperhash":"anonymous|learning_to_teach","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018learning,          \ntitle={Learning to Teach},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper490/Authors"],"keywords":[]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509134715639,"tcdate":1509124180609,"number":489,"cdate":1509124180609,"id":"H1aIuk-RW","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"H1aIuk-RW","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Active Learning for Convolutional Neural Networks: A Core-Set Approach","abstract":"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to many recognition and learning tasks using a universal recipe;  training a deep model on a very large dataset of supervised examples.

In this paper, we develop a memory system with an adaptable write operator that is customized to the sorts of 3D environments that DRL agents typically interact with.

In this paper, we propose a new neural method for this problem, and present empirical evaluations on a structured Question answering task and three related goal-oriented dialog tasks that show that our proposed method can be effective in interacting with NEs in these settings.","pdf":"/pdf/e3ddf7521b640485669066de78856b17d958d75e.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|a_neural_method_for_goaloriented_dialog_systems_to_interact_with_named_entities","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018a,          \ntitle={A Neural Method for Goal-Oriented Dialog Systems to interact with Named Entities},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper466/Authors"],"keywords":["Named Entities","Neural methods","Goal oriented dialog"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509126790791,"tcdate":1509121140381,"number":465,"cdate":1509121140381,"id":"HJ3d2Ax0-","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"HJ3d2Ax0-","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Benefits of Depth for Long-Term Memory of Recurrent Networks","abstract":"The key attribute that drives the unprecedented success of modern Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) on learning tasks which involve sequential data, is their ever-improving ability to model intricate long-term temporal dependencies. However, a well established measure of RNNs' long-term memory capacity is lacking, and thus formal understanding of their ability to correlate data throughout time is limited. Though depth efficiency in convolutional networks is well established by now, it does not suffice in order to account for the success of deep RNNs on inputs of varying lengths, and the need to address their 'time-series expressive power' arises. In this paper, we analyze the effect of depth on the ability of recurrent networks to express correlations ranging over long time-scales. To meet the above need, we introduce a measure of the information flow across time that can be supported by the network, referred to as the Start-End separation rank. Essentially, this measure reflects the distance of the function realized by the recurrent network from a function that models no interaction whatsoever between the beginning and end of the input sequence. We prove that deep recurrent networks support Start-End separation ranks which are exponentially higher than those supported by their shallow counterparts. Moreover, we show that the ability of deep recurrent networks to correlate different parts of the input sequence increases exponentially as the input sequence extends, while that of vanilla shallow recurrent networks does not adapt to the sequence length at all. Thus, we establish that depth brings forth an overwhelming advantage in the ability of recurrent networks to model long-term dependencies, and provide an exemplar of quantifying this key attribute which may be readily extended to other RNN architectures of interest, e.g. variants of LSTM networks. We obtain our results by considering a class of recurrent networks referred to as Recurrent Arithmetic Circuits (RACs), which merge the hidden state with the input via the Multiplicative Integration operation.","pdf":"/pdf/967bc97f0d7c0b7f6d7adc80dc2ecd8c9683bda9.pdf","TL;DR":"We propose a measure of long-term memory and prove that deep recurrent networks are much better fit to model long-term temporal dependencies than shallow ones.","paperhash":"anonymous|benefits_of_depth_for_longterm_memory_of_recurrent_networks","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018benefits,          \ntitle={Benefits of Depth for Long-Term Memory of Recurrent Networks},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper465/Authors"],"keywords":["recurrent neural networks","deep networks","correlations","long term memory","tensor networks","tensor analysis"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509135617787,"tcdate":1509120655052,"number":464,"cdate":1509120655052,"id":"r1vccClCb","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"r1vccClCb","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Neighbor-encoder","abstract":"We propose a novel unsupervised representation learning framework called neighbor-encoder in which domain knowledge can be trivially incorporated into the learning process without modifying the general encoder-decoder architecture.

The reasons behind the improved behavior are that ELU reduces the bias shift, it saturates for large negative inputs and it is continuously differentiable. However, it remains open whether ELU has the optimal shape and we address the quest for a superior activation function.\nWe use a new formulation to tune a piecewise linear activation function during training, to investigate the above question, and learn the shape of the locally optimal activation function. With this tuned activation function, the classification performance is improved and the resulting, learned activation function shows to be ELU-shaped irrespective if it is initialized as a RELU, LReLU or ELU. Interestingly, the learned activation function does not exactly pass through the origin indicating that a shifted ELU-shaped activation function is preferable. This observation leads us to introduce the Shifted Exponential Linear Unit (ShELU) as a new activation function.\nExperiments on Cifar-100 show that the classification performance is further improved when using the ShELU activation function in comparison with ELU.

The distribution of the style features can change in the future. While transfer learning and domain adaptation would try to adapt to a shift in the distribution(s), we here want to protect against future adversarial domain shifts, arising through changing style features, by ideally not using the mutable style features altogether. \n\nThere are two broad scenarios and we show how exploiting grouping information in the data helps in both. (a) If the style features are known explicitly (such as translation, rotation, etc.) one usually proceeds by using data augmentation. By exploiting the grouping information about which original image an augmented sample belongs to, we can reduce the sample size required to achieve invariance to the style feature in question. (b) Sometimes the style features are not known explicitly but we still have information about samples that belong to the same underlying object (such as pictures of the same person in different circumstances). By constraining the classification to give the same forecast for all instances that belong to the same object,  we show how using this grouping information leads to invariance to such implicit style features  and helps to protect against adversarial domain shifts. \n\nWe provide a causal framework for the problem and treat groups of instances of the same object as counterfactuals under different  interventions on the mutable style features. We show links to questions of interpretability, fairness, transfer learning and adversarial examples.

With the rise in the use of machine learning in mission critical day-to-day activities where errors may have significant consequences, it is imperative that machine learning systems are made secure. To address this, we propose a defense mechanism that is based on a contraction of the data, and we test its effectiveness using OCSVMs. The proposed approach introduces a layer of uncertainty on top of the OCSVM learner, making it infeasible for the adversary to guess the specific configuration of the learner. We theoretically analyze the effects of adversarial perturbations on the separating margin of OCSVMs and provide empirical evidence on several benchmark datasets, which show that by carefully contracting the data in low dimensional spaces, we can successfully identify adversarial samples that would not have been identifiable in the original dimensional space.

(2) The generator (G) is (often) formulated as a continuous function, and the input noise is derived from a connected set, due to which G's output must be a connected set. If G covers all modes, then there must be some portion of G's output which connects them. This corresponds to undesirable, conflated images. We develop theoretical arguments to support these intuitions. We propose a novel method to break the second assumption via learnable discontinuities in the latent noise space. Equivalently, it can be viewed as training several generators, thus creating discontinuities in the G function. We also augment the GAN formulation with a classifier C that predicts which noise partition/generator produced the output images, thus encouraging diversity between each partition/generator.

The majority of past work in semantic code repair assumed access to unit tests against which candidate repairs could be validated. In contrast, the goal here is to develop a strong statistical model to accurately predict both bug locations and exact fixes without access to information about the intended correct behavior of the program. Achieving such a goal requires a robust contextual repair model, which we train on a large corpus of real-world source code that has been augmented with synthetically injected bugs. Our framework adopts a two-stage approach where first a large set of repair candidates are generated by rule-based processors, and then these candidates are scored by a statistical model using a novel neural network architecture which we refer to as Share, Specialize, and Compete. Specifically, the architecture (1) generates a  shared encoding of the source code using an RNN over the abstract syntax tree, (2) scores each candidate repair using specialized network modules, and (3) then normalizes these scores together so they can compete against one another in comparable probability space. We evaluate our model on a real-world test set gathered from GitHub containing four common categories of bugs. Our model is able to predict the exact correct repair 41% of the time with a single guess, compared to 13% accuracy for an attentional sequence-to-sequence model.","pdf":"/pdf/7150529f3edbb412d0b0a7b4ff06b2a2bb01dd9e.pdf","TL;DR":"A neural architecture for scoring and ranking program repair candidates to perform semantic program repair statically without access to unit tests.","paperhash":"anonymous|semantic_code_repair_using_neurosymbolic_transformation_networks","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018semantic,          \ntitle={Semantic Code Repair using Neuro-Symbolic Transformation Networks},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper439/Authors"],"keywords":["semantic program repair","neural program embeddings","deep learning"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509117708474,"tcdate":1509117708272,"number":438,"cdate":1509117708272,"id":"BkVf1AeAZ","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"BkVf1AeAZ","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Label Embedding Network: Learning Label Representation for Soft Training of Deep Networks","abstract":"We propose a method, called Label Embedding Network, which can learn label representation (label embedding) during the training process of deep networks.

One way to reduce this large memory footprint is to reduce the precision of activations. However, past works have shown that reducing the precision of activations hurts model accuracy. We study schemes to train networks from scratch using reduced-precision activations without hurting accuracy. We reduce the precision of activation maps (along with model parameters) and increase the number of filter maps in a layer, and find that this scheme matches or surpasses the accuracy of the baseline full-precision network. As a result, one can significantly improve the execution efficiency (e.g. reduce dynamic memory footprint, memory band- width and computational energy) and speed up the training and inference process with appropriate hardware support.

While the celebrated Word2Vec technique yields semantically rich word representations, it is less clear whether sentence or document representations should be built upon word representations or from scratch. Recent work has demonstrated that a distance measure between documents called \\emph{Word Mover's Distance} (WMD) that aligns semantically similar words, yields unprecedented KNN classification accuracy. However, WMD is very expensive to compute, and is harder to apply beyond simple KNN than feature embeddings. In this paper, we propose the \\emph{Word Mover's Embedding } (WME), a novel approach to building an unsupervised document (sentence) embedding from pre-trained word embeddings. Our technique extends the theory of \\emph{Random Features} to show convergence of the inner product between WMEs to a positive-definite kernel that can be interpreted as a soft version of (inverse) WMD. The proposed embedding is more efficient and flexible than WMD in many situations. As an example, WME with a simple linear classifier reduces the computational cost of WMD-based KNN \\emph{from cubic to linear} in document length and \\emph{from quadratic to linear} in number of samples, while simultaneously improving accuracy. In experiments on 9 benchmark text classification datasets and 22 textual similarity tasks the proposed technique consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, with significantly higher accuracy on problems of short length.","pdf":"/pdf/8753a63b86a21a282a3c1ae5d3a39fc61dd2f2f9.pdf","TL;DR":"A novel approach to building an unsupervised document (sentence) embeddings from pre-trainedword embeddings","paperhash":"anonymous|word_movers_embedding_from_word2vec_to_document_embedding","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018word,          \ntitle={Word Mover's Embedding: From Word2Vec to Document Embedding},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper418/Authors"],"keywords":["Word2Vec","Word Mover's Distance","Document Embedding"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509130004286,"tcdate":1509115567176,"number":417,"cdate":1509115567176,"id":"S1Dh8Tg0-","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"S1Dh8Tg0-","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Fix your classifier: the marginal value of training the last weight layer","abstract":"Neural networks are commonly used as models for classification for a wide variety of tasks.

This property is preferable to visual tracking where annotated video sequences for training are always absent, because rich features learned by detectors from still images could be utilized by dynamic trackers. It also avoids extra machinery such as feature engineering and feature aggregation proposed in previous studies. Tracking loss achieves this property by exploiting the internal structure of feature maps within the detection network and treating different feature points discriminatively. Such structure allows us to simultaneously consider discrimination quality and bounding box accuracy which is found to be crucial to the success. We also propose a network compression method to accelerate tracking speed without performance reduction. That also verifies tracking loss will remain highly effective even if the network is drastically compressed. Furthermore, if we employ a carefully designed tracking loss ensemble, the tracker would be much more robust and accurate. Evaluation results show that our trackers (including the ensemble tracker and two baseline trackers), outperform all state-of-the-art methods on VOT 2016 Challenge in terms of Expected Average Overlap (EAO) and robustness.

The most general way to enforce this is by adopting an $L_0$ norm as a penalty on the weights. However, since the $L_0$ norm is non-differentiable, we cannot incorporate it directly as a regularization term in the objective function. We propose a solution through the inclusion of a collection of non-negative stochastic gates, which collectively determine which weights to set to zero. We show that, somewhat surprisingly, the expected $L_0$ norm of the resulting gated weights is differentiable with respect to the distribution parameters for certain well-chosen probability distributions over the gates. To this end, we employ a novel distribution over gates, which we name the \\emph{hard concrete}; it is obtained by ``stretching'' a binary concrete distribution and then transforming its samples with a hard-sigmoid. The parameters of the distribution over the gates can then be jointly optimized with the original network parameters. As a result our method allows for straightforward and efficient learning of model structures with stochastic gradient descent and allows for conditional computation in a principled way. We perform various experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the resulting approach and regularizer.","pdf":"/pdf/1f6a6ec066b3e65fb45056f4988449b9b4e9ae0b.pdf","TL;DR":"We show how to optimize the expected L_0 norm of parametric models with gradient descent and introduce a new distribution that facilitates hard gating.","paperhash":"anonymous|learning_sparse_neural_networks_through_l_0_regularization","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018learning,          \ntitle={Learning Sparse Neural Networks through L_0 Regularization},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper402/Authors"],"keywords":["Sparsity","compression","hard and soft attention."]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509133977950,"tcdate":1509112757509,"number":401,"cdate":1509112757509,"id":"Hyp3i2xRb","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"Hyp3i2xRb","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Overcoming the vanishing gradient problem in plain recurrent networks","abstract":"Plain recurrent networks greatly suffer from the vanishing gradient problem while Gated Neural Networks (GNNs) such as Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) deliver promising results in many sequence learning tasks through sophisticated network designs.

However, the state-of-art deep neural networks are known to be highly overconfident in their predictions, i.e., do not distinguish in- and out-of-distributions. Recently, to handle this issue, several threshold-based detectors have been proposed given pre-trained neural classifiers. However, the performance of prior works highly depends on how to train the classifiers since they only focus on improving inference procedures. In this paper, we develop a novel training method for classifiers so that such inference algorithms can work better. In particular, we suggest two additional terms added to the original loss (e.g., cross entropy). The first one forces samples from out-of-distribution less confident by the classifier and the second one is for (implicitly) generating most effective training samples for the first one. In essence, our method jointly trains both classification and generative neural networks for out-of-distribution.

However, general guidance to network architecture design is still missing. In our work, we bridge deep neural network design with numerical differential equations. We show that many effective networks, such as ResNet, PolyNet, FractalNet and RevNet, can be interpreted as different numerical discretizations of differential equations. This finding brings us a brand new perspective on the design of effective deep architectures. We can take advantage of the rich knowledge in numerical analysis to guide us in designing new and potentially more effective deep networks. As an example, we propose a linear multi-step architecture (LM-architecture) which is inspired by the linear multi-step method solving ordinary differential equations. The LM-architecture is an effective structure that can be used on any ResNet-like networks. In particular, we demonstrate that LM-ResNet and LM-ResNeXt (i.e. the networks obtained by applying the LM-architecture on ResNet and ResNeXt respectively) can achieve noticeably higher accuracy than ResNet and ResNeXt on both CIFAR and ImageNet with comparable numbers of trainable parameters. In particular, on both CIFAR and ImageNet, LM-ResNet/LM-ResNeXt can significantly compress (>50%) the original networks while maintaining a similar performance. This can be explained mathematically using the concept of modified equation from numerical analysis. Last but not least, we also establish a connection between stochastic control and noise injection in the training process which helps to improve generalization of the networks. Furthermore, by relating stochastic training strategy with stochastic dynamic system, we can easily apply stochastic training to the networks with the LM-architecture.

The central question of this work is, how the temporal nature of reality should be reflected in the execution of a deep neural network and its components. Most artificial deep neural networks are partitioned into a directed graph of connected modules or layers and the layers themselves consist of elemental building blocks, such as single units. For most deep neural networks, all units of a layer are processed synchronously and in parallel, but layers themselves are processed in a sequential manner. In contrast, all elements of a biological neural network are processed in parallel. In this paper, we define a class of networks between these two extreme cases. These networks are executed in a streaming or synchronous layerwise-parallel manner, unlocking the layers of such networks for parallel processing. Compared to the standard layerwise-sequential deep networks, these new layerwise-parallel networks show a fundamentally different temporal behavior and flow of information, especially for networks with skip or recurrent connections. We argue that layerwise-parallel deep networks are better suited for future challenges of deep neural network design, such as large functional modularized and/or recurrent architectures as well as networks allocating different network capacities dependent on current stimulus and/or task complexity.

In order to simulate the above described challenges, we introduce a new 2D environment for an agent to jointly learn visual and textual modalities.","pdf":"/pdf/3dc541a16594ed79d05221029f1a6ddaf0426bd0.pdf","TL;DR":"Novel architecture for language grounding via reinforcement learning in a new customizable 2D grid environment  ","paperhash":"anonymous|learning_to_navigate_by_distilling_visual_information_and_natural_language_instructions","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018learning,          \ntitle={Learning to navigate by distilling visual information and natural language instructions},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper388/Authors"],"keywords":["Deep reinforcement learning","Computer Vision","Multi-modal fusion","Language Grounding"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509140745908,"tcdate":1509110830992,"number":387,"cdate":1509110830992,"id":"S1v4N2l0-","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"S1v4N2l0-","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Unsupervised Representation Learning by Predicting Image Rotations","abstract":"Over the last years, deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have transformed the field of computer vision thanks to their  unparalleled capacity to learn high level semantic image features. However, in order to successfully learn those features, they usually require massive amounts of manually labeled data, which is both expensive and impractical to scale. Therefore, unsupervised semantic feature learning, i.e., learning without requiring manual annotation effort, is of crucial importance in order to successfully harvest the vast amount of visual data that are available today. In our work we propose to learn image features by training ConvNets to recognize the 2d rotation that is applied to the image that it gets as input. \nWe demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative that this apparently simple task actually provides a very powerful supervisory signal for semantic feature learning.  We exhaustively evaluate our method in various unsupervised feature learning benchmarks and we exhibit in all of them remarkably good performance. Even more, our results on those benchmarks demonstrate dramatic improvements w.r.t. prior state-of-the-art, thus they significantly close the gap between unsupervised and supervised feature learning. For instance, in PASCAL VOC 2007 detection task our unsupervised pre-trained AlexNet model achieves the state-of-the-art (among unsupervised methods) mAP of $54.4\\%$ that is only 2.4 points lower from the supervised case. Similar striking results we get when transfer our unsupervised learned features on various other tasks, such as ImageNet classification, PASCAL classification, and CIFAR-10 classification.","pdf":"/pdf/961b1b17788954a27dcfd389a828ea6858b107ea.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|place_holder","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018place,          \ntitle={Place holder},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","keywords":["Unsupervised representation learning"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper387/Authors"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509118197252,"tcdate":1509110814475,"number":386,"cdate":1509110814475,"id":"S1LXVnxRb","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"S1LXVnxRb","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Cross-Corpus Training with TreeLSTM for the Extraction of Biomedical Relationships from Text","abstract":"A bottleneck problem in machine learning-based relationship extraction (RE) algorithms, and particularly of deep learning-based ones, is the availability of training data in the form of annotated corpora. For specific domains, such as biomedicine, the long time and high expertise required for the development of manually annotated corpora explain that most of the existing one are relatively small (i.e., hundreds of sentences). Beside, larger corpora focusing on general or domain-specific relationships (such as citizenship or drug-drug interactions) have been developed. In this paper, we study how large annotated corpora developed for alternative tasks may improve the performances on biomedicine related tasks, for which few annotated resources are available. We experiment two deep learning-based models to extract relationships from biomedical texts with high performance. The first one combine locally extracted features using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, while the second exploit the syntactic structure of sentences using a Recursive Neural Network (RNN) architecture. Our experiments show that, contrary to the former, the latter benefits from a cross-corpus learning strategy to improve the performance of relationship extraction tasks. Indeed our approach leads to state-of-the-art performances for four biomedical RE tasks for which few annotated resources are available (less than 400 manually annotated sentences). This may be particularly impactful in specialized domains in which training resources are scarce, because they would benefit from the training data of other domains for which large annotated corpora does exist.","pdf":"/pdf/1b5a23250a176e187c5941bb8e3d2810e5d25138.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|crosscorpus_training_with_treelstm_for_the_extraction_of_biomedical_relationships_from_text","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018cross-corpus,          \ntitle={Cross-Corpus Training with TreeLSTM for the Extraction of Biomedical Relationships from Text},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper386/Authors"],"keywords":["Relationships Extraction","Deep Learning","TreeLSTM","NLP"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509139883185,"tcdate":1509110571995,"number":385,"cdate":1509110571995,"id":"SyVVXngRW","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"SyVVXngRW","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Deep Asymmetric Multi-task Feature Learning","abstract":"We propose Deep Asymmetric Multitask Feature Learning (Deep-AMTFL) which can learn deep representations shared across multiple tasks while effectively preventing negative transfer that may happen in the feature sharing process.

To do so, the embedding normalizes features in the context of the problem, and discretizes their values to reduce noise and regularize the embedding space.

Thus, each SAN only needs to process a short sequence, and only a small amount of memory is required. Additionally, we use feature-level attention to handle the variation of contexts around the same word, and use forward/backward masks to encode temporal order information.

However, the variations in images pose a challenge to this fashion. In this paper, we propose to generate sample-specific filters for convolutional layers in the forward pass. Since the filters are generated on-the-fly, the model becomes more flexible and can better fit the training data compared to traditional CNNs. In order to obtain sample-specific features, we extract the intermediate feature maps from an autoencoder. As filters are usually high dimensional, we propose to learn a set of coefficients instead of a set of filters.

However, on portable devices with limited resources, the models are often too large to deploy. For applications on the server with large scale concurrent requests, the latency during inference can also be very critical for costly computing resources. In this work, we address these problems by quantizing the network, both weights and activations, into multiple binary codes {-1,+1}. We formulate the quantization as an optimization problem. Under the key observation that once the quantization coefficients are fixed the binary codes can be derived efficiently by binary search tree, alternating minimization is then applied.  We test the quantization for two well-known RNNs, i.e., long short term memory (LSTM) and gate recurrent unit (GRU), on the language models. Compared with the full-precision counter part, by 2-bit quantization we can achieve ~16x memory saving and  potential ~13.5x   inference acceleration on CPUs, with only a reasonable loss in the accuracy. By 3-bit quantization, we can achieve almost no loss in the accuracy or even surpass the original model, with ~10.5x memory saving and potential ~6.5x inference acceleration. Both results beat the exiting quantization works with large margins.

While adversarial training improves the robustness of classifiers against such adversarial perturbations, it leaves classifiers sensitive to them on a non-negligible fraction of the inputs. We argue that there are two different kinds of adversarial perturbations: shared perturbations which fool a classifier on many inputs and singular perturbations which only fool the classifier on a small fraction of the data. We find that adversarial training increases the robustness of classifiers against shared perturbations. Moreover, it is particularly effective in removing universal perturbations, which can be seen as an extreme form of shared perturbations. Unfortunately, adversarial training does not consistently increase the robustness against singular perturbations on unseen inputs. However, we find that adversarial training decreases robustness of the remaining perturbations against image transformations such as changes to contrast and brightness or  Gaussian blurring. It thus makes successful attacks on the classifier in the physical world less likely. Finally, we show that even singular perturbations can be easily detected and must thus exhibit generalizable patterns even though the perturbations are specific for certain inputs.

Because making observations is costly, this decision must trade off the value of information against the cost of observation. Making observations (sensing) should be an active choice. To solve the problem of active sensing we develop a novel deep learning architecture: Deep Sensing. At training time, Deep Sensing learns how to issue predictions at various cost-performance points. To do this, it creates multiple representations at various performance levels associated with different measurement rates (costs). This requires learning how to estimate the value of real measurements vs. inferred measurements, which in turn requires learning how to infer missing (unobserved) measurements.  To infer missing measurements, we develop a Multi-directional Recurrent Neural Network (M-RNN).  An M-RNN differs from a bi-directional RNN in that it sequentially operates across streams in addition to within streams, and because the timing of inputs into the hidden layers is both lagged and advanced.  At runtime, the operator prescribes a performance level or a cost constraint, and Deep Sensing determines what measurements to take and what to infer from those measurements, and then issues predictions. To demonstrate the power of our method, we apply it to two real-world medical datasets with significantly improved performance.","pdf":"/pdf/714bbe26098d0e35553a3f84188be102486594a1.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|deep_sensing_active_sensing_using_multidirectional_recurrent_neural_networks","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018deep,          \ntitle={Deep Sensing: Active Sensing using Multi-directional Recurrent Neural Networks},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper350/Authors"],"keywords":["Active Sensing","Timely Prediction","Irregular Sampling","Missing Data"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509133992302,"tcdate":1509102279264,"number":349,"cdate":1509102279264,"id":"BJy0fcgRZ","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"BJy0fcgRZ","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Capturing Human Category Representations by Sampling in Deep Feature Spaces","abstract":"Understanding how people represent categories is a core problem in cognitive science, with the flexibility of human learning remaining a gold standard to which modern artificial intelligence and machine learning aspires. Decades of psychological research have yielded a variety of formal theories of categories, yet validating these theories with naturalistic stimuli remains a challenge. The problem is that human category representations cannot be directly observed and running informative experiments with naturalistic stimuli such as images requires having a reasonable representation of these images. Deep neural networks have recently been successful in a range of computer vision tasks and provide a way to represent the features of images. In this paper, we outline a method for estimating the structure of human categories that draws on ideas from both cognitive science and machine learning, blending human-based algorithms with state-of-the-art deep representation learners. We provide qualitative and quantitative results as a proof of concept for the feasibility of the method. Samples drawn from human distributions rival the quality of current state-of-the-art generative models and outperform alternative methods for estimating the structure of human categories.","pdf":"/pdf/2a8c2e9a1fc39db5544bd7c9504f7374c7f16e94.pdf","TL;DR":"using deep neural networks and clever algorithms to capture human mental visual concepts","paperhash":"anonymous|capturing_human_category_representations_by_sampling_in_deep_feature_spaces","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018capturing,          \ntitle={Capturing Human Category Representations by Sampling in Deep Feature Spaces},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper349/Authors"],"keywords":["category representations","psychology","cognitive science","deep neural networks"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"ddate":null,"tddate":1509200780981,"tmdate":1509200780981,"tcdate":1509102218399,"number":348,"cdate":1509200665164,"id":"H1MczcgR-","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"H1MczcgR-","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Understanding Short-Horizon Bias in Stochastic Meta-Optimization","abstract":"Careful tuning of the learning rate, or even schedules thereof, can be crucial to effective neural net training. There has been much recent interest in gradient-based meta-optimization, where one tunes hyperparameters, or even learns an optimizer, in order to minimize the expected loss when the training procedure is unrolled. But because the training procedure must be unrolled thousands of times, the meta-objective must be defined with an orders-of-magnitude shorter time horizon than is typical for neural net training. We show that such short-horizon meta-objectives cause a serious bias towards small step sizes, an effect we term short-horizon bias. We introduce a toy problem, a noisy quadratic cost function, on which we analyze short-horizon bias by deriving and comparing the optimal schedules for short and long time horizons. We then run meta-optimization experiments (both offline and online) on standard benchmark datasets, showing that meta-optimization chooses too small a learning rate by multiple orders of magnitude, even when run with a moderately long time horizon (100 steps) typical of work in the area. We believe short-horizon bias is a fundamental problem that needs to be addressed if meta-optimization is to scale to practical neural net training regimes.","pdf":"/pdf/0c4d4ac33c7d38f86775a6ac02ba3bd1c8a07780.pdf","TL;DR":"We investigate the bias in the short-horizon meta-optimization objective.","paperhash":"wu|placeholder","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018placeholder,          \ntitle={Placeholder},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","keywords":["meta-learning; optimization; short-horizon bias."],"authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper348/Authors"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509102171582,"tcdate":1509102171358,"number":347,"cdate":1509102171358,"id":"BJQPG5lR-","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"BJQPG5lR-","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Variable Activation Networks: A simple method to train deep feed-forward networks without skip-connections","abstract":"Novel architectures such as ResNets have enabled the training of very deep feed-forward networks via the introduction of skip-connections, leading to state-of-the-art results in many applications.

Beyond providing a good density model a VAE model assigns to each data instance a latent code. In many applications, this latent code provides a useful high-level summary of the observation. However, the VAE may fail to learn a useful representation when the decoder family is very expressive. This is because maximum likelihood does not explicitly encourage useful representations and the latent variable is used only if it helps model the marginal distribution. This makes representation learning with VAEs unreliable. To address this issue, we propose a method for explicitly controlling the amount of information stored in the latent code. Our method can learn codes ranging from independent to nearly deterministic while benefiting from decoder capacity. Thus, we decouple the choice of decoder capacity and the latent code dimensionality from the amount of information stored in the code.\n","pdf":"/pdf/0de2556a527a6a914b6205ba3128aef4a860889c.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|the_mutual_autoencoder_controlling_information_in_latent_code_representations","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018the,          \ntitle={The Mutual Autoencoder: Controlling Information in Latent Code Representations},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper346/Authors"],"keywords":[]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509101780074,"tcdate":1509101778739,"number":345,"cdate":1509101778739,"id":"BkoCeqgR-","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"BkoCeqgR-","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"On the Construction and Evaluation of Color Invariant Networks","abstract":"This is an empirical paper which constructs color invariant networks and evaluates their performances on a realistic data set.

Although mathematically tractable, the use of  exponentially decaying weighting of n-step returns based targets in lambda-returns is a rather ad-hoc design choice. Our major contribution  is that we propose a generalization of lambda-returns called Confidence-based Autodidactic Returns (CAR), wherein the RL agent learns the weighting of the n-step returns in an end-to-end manner. In contrast to lambda-returns wherein the RL agent is restricted to use an exponentially decaying weighting scheme, CAR allows the agent to learn to decide how much it wants to weigh the n-step returns based targets. Our experiments, in addition to showing the efficacy of CAR, also empirically demonstrate that using sophisticated weighted mixtures of multi-step returns (like CAR and lambda-returns) considerably outperforms the use of n-step returns.

For this purpose, we propose to construct the embeddings with few basis vectors. For each word, the composition of basis vectors is determined by a hash code. To maximize the compression rate, we adopt the multi-codebook quantization approach instead of binary coding scheme. Each code is composed of multiple discrete numbers, such as (3, 2, 1, 8), where the value of each component is limited to a fixed range.

We extend the BA-SGD to momentum algorithm and evaluate both the BA-SGD and the batch adaptive momentum (BA-Momentum) on two deep learning tasks from natural language processing to image classification. Experiments confirm that batch adaptive methods can achieve a lower loss compared with mini-batch methods after scanning the same epochs of data.

State-of-the-art optimizers, such as AdaGrad, RMSProp and Adam, reduce this labor by adaptively tuning an individual learning rate for each variable. Recently researchers have shown renewed interest in simpler methods like momentum SGD as they may yield better results. Motivated by this trend, we ask: can simple adaptive methods, based on SGD perform as well or better? We revisit the momentum SGD algorithm and show that hand-tuning a single learning rate and momentum makes it competitive with Adam. We then analyze its robustness to learning rate misspecification and objective curvature variation.

In image classification tasks, for example, averaging the predictions for multiple patches extracted from the input image significantly improves accuracy. Using multiple networks trained independently to make predictions improves accuracy further. One obvious drawback of the ensembling technique is its higher execution cost during inference. This higher cost limits the real-world use of ensembling. In this paper, we describe a new technique called adaptive ensemble prediction, which achieves the benefits of ensembling with much smaller additional execution costs. Our observation behind this technique is that ensembling does not reduce mispredictions for inputs predicted with a high probability, i.e. the outputs from the softmax. Hence, we calculate the confidence level of the prediction for each input from the probabilities of the local predictions during the ensembling computation. If the prediction for an input reaches a high enough probability on the basis of the confidence level, we stop ensembling for this input to avoid wasting computation power. We evaluated the adaptive ensembling by using various datasets and showed that it reduces the computation cost significantly while achieving similar accuracy to the naive ensembling. We also showed that our statistically rigorous confidence-level-based termination condition reduces the burden of the task-dependent parameter tuning compared to the naive termination based on the pre-defined threshold in addition to yielding a better accuracy with the same cost.","pdf":"/pdf/a74400f110180eb9b2059519a511cbcda5f4a642.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|fast_and_accurate_inference_with_adaptive_ensemble_prediction_for_deep_networks","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018fast,          \ntitle={Fast and Accurate Inference with Adaptive Ensemble Prediction for Deep Networks},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper309/Authors"],"keywords":["ensemble","confidence level"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509094751875,"tcdate":1509094751620,"number":308,"cdate":1509094751620,"id":"B1uvH_gC-","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"B1uvH_gC-","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Parametric Manifold Learning Via Sparse Multidimensional Scaling","abstract":"We propose a metric-learning framework for computing distance-preserving maps that generate low-dimensional embeddings for a certain class of manifolds.

Unfortunately they are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, formed by applying small but malicious perturbations to the original inputs. Moreover, the perturbations can transfer across models: adversarial examples generated for a specific model will often mislead other unseen models. Consequently  the adversary can leverage it to attack against the deployed black-box systems. \nIn this work, we demonstrate that the adversarial perturbation can be decomposed into two components: model-specific and data-dependent one, and it is the latter that mainly contributes to the transferability. Motivated by this understanding, we propose to craft adversarial examples by utilizing the noise reduced gradient (NRG) which approximates the data-dependent component. Experiments on various classification models trained on ImageNet demonstrates that the new approach enhances the transferability dramatically. We also find that low-capacity models have more powerful attack capability than high-capacity counterparts, under the condition that they have comparable test performance.  These insights give rise to a principled manner to construct adversarial examples with high success rates and could potentially provide us guidance for designing effective defense approaches against black-box attacks.

The partial reward function is a reward function for a partial sequence of a certain length. SeqGAN employs a reward function for completed sequence only. By combining long-scale and short-scale partial reward functions, we expect a learned metric to be able to evaluate a partial correctness as well as a coherence of a sequence, as a whole. In expert-based reward function training, a reward function is trained to discriminate between an expert (or true) sequence and a fake sequence that is produced by editing an expert sequence. Expert-based reward function training is not a kind of GAN frameworks. This makes the optimization of the generator easier. We examine the effect of the partial reward function and expert-based reward function training on synthetic data and real text data, and show improvements over SeqGAN and the model trained with MLE. Specifically, whereas SeqGAN gains 0.42 improvement of NLL over MLE on synthetic data, our best model gains 3.02 improvement, and whereas SeqGAN gains 0.029 improvement of BLEU over MLE, our best model gains 0.250 improvement.","pdf":"/pdf/3360c542d1569cadfade4aecfbca660ef745fae3.pdf","TL;DR":"This paper aims to learn a better metric for unsupervised learning, such as text generation, and shows a significant improvement over SeqGAN.","paperhash":"anonymous|toward_learning_better_metrics_for_sequence_generation_training_with_policy_gradient","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018toward,          \ntitle={Toward learning better metrics for sequence generation training with policy gradient},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper289/Authors"],"keywords":["sequence generation","reinforcement learning","unsupervised learning","RNN"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509119891355,"tcdate":1509089870668,"number":288,"cdate":1509089870668,"id":"S1D8MPxA-","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"S1D8MPxA-","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Viterbi-based Pruning for Sparse Matrix with Fixed and High Index Compression Ratio","abstract":"Weight pruning has proven to be an effective method in reducing the model size and computation cost while not sacrificing the model accuracy. Conventional sparse matrix formats, however, involve irregular index structures with large storage requirement and sequential reconstruction process, resulting in inefficient use of highly parallel computing resources. Hence, pruning is usually restricted to inference with a batch size of one, for which an efficient parallel matrix-vector multiplication method exists. In this paper, a new class of sparse matrix representation utilizing Viterbi algorithm that has a high, and more importantly, fixed index compression ratio regardless of the pruning rate, is proposed. In this approach, numerous sparse matrix candidates are first generated by the Viterbi encoder, and then the one that aims to minimize the model accuracy degradation is selected by the Viterbi algorithm. The model pruning process based on the proposed Viterbi encoder and Viterbi algorithm is highly parallelizable, and can be implemented efficiently in hardware to achieve low-energy, high-performance index decoding process. Compared with the existing magnitude-based pruning methods, index data storage requirement can be further compressed by 85.2% in MNIST and 83.9% in AlexNet while achieving similar pruning rate. Even compared with the relative index compression technique, our method can still reduce the index storage requirement by 52.7% in MNIST and 35.5% in AlexNet.","pdf":"/pdf/7767c0e3687c37b11545ddc6f7abe5ec9645991f.pdf","TL;DR":"We present a new pruning method and sparse matrix format to enable high index compression ratio and parallel index decoding process.","paperhash":"anonymous|viterbibased_pruning_for_sparse_matrix_with_fixed_and_high_index_compression_ratio","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018viterbi-based,          \ntitle={Viterbi-based Pruning for Sparse Matrix with Fixed and High Index Compression Ratio},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper288/Authors"],"keywords":["pruning","sparse matrix","memory footprint","model size","model compression"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509136846590,"tcdate":1509089532413,"number":287,"cdate":1509089532413,"id":"HyN-ZvlC-","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"HyN-ZvlC-","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Large Margin Neural Language Models","abstract":"Neural language models (NLMs) are generative, and they model the distribution of grammatical sentences.

Essentially, we train an auto-encoder as a bridge to enable the transformation between the image feature space and the semantic space. Besides directly augmenting image features, we transform the image features to semantic space using the encoder and perform the data augmentation. The decoder then synthesizes the image features for the augmented instances from the semantic space.

An extensive study shows that data augmented from semantic space are complementary with those from the image space, and thus boost the classification accuracy dramatically.

While such approaches offer a promising solution to the multi-task learning problem, they require supervision from large expert networks which require extensive data and computation time for training.\nIn this work, we propose an efficient multi-task learning framework which solves multiple goal-directed tasks in an on-line setup without the need for expert supervision. Our work uses active learning principles to achieve multi-task learning by sampling the harder tasks more than the easier ones. We propose three distinct models under our active sampling framework. An adaptive method with extremely competitive multi-tasking performance. A UCB-based meta-learner which casts the problem of picking the next task to train on as a multi-armed bandit problem. A meta-learning method that casts the next-task picking problem as a full Reinforcement Learning problem and uses actor-critic methods for optimizing the multi-tasking performance directly.

By maximizing both the marginal and the conditional log-likelihoods, models derived from this framework can use both labeled instances from the source domain as well as unlabeled instances from \\emph{both} source and target domains.

In this paper, we introduce a simple but surprisingly effective data augmentation technique for image classification tasks. With our technique, named SamplePairing, we synthesize a new sample from one image by overlaying another image randomly chosen from the training data (i.e., taking an average of two images for each pixel). By using two images randomly selected from the training set, we can generate N^2 new samples from N training samples. This simple data augmentation technique significantly improved classification accuracy for all the tested datasets; for example, the top-1 error rate was reduced from 33.5% to 29.0% for the ILSVRC 2012 dataset with GoogLeNet and from 8.22% to 6.93% in the CIFAR-10 dataset.

RAML incorporates task-specific reward by performing maximum-likelihood updates on candidate outputs sampled according to an exponentiated payoff distribution, which gives higher probabilities to candidates that are close to the reference output. While RAML is notable for its simplicity, efficiency, and its impressive empirical successes, the theoretical properties of RAML, especially the behavior of the exponentiated payoff distribution, has not been examined thoroughly. In this work, we introduce softmax Q-distribution estimation, a novel theoretical interpretation of RAML, which reveals the relation between RAML and Bayesian decision theory. The softmax Q-distribution can be regarded as a smooth approximation of the Bayes decision boundary, and the Bayes decision rule is achieved by decoding with this Q-distribution. We further show that RAML is equivalent to approximately estimating the softmax Q-distribution, with the temperature $\\tau$ controlling approximation error. We perform two experiments, one on synthetic data of multi-class classification and one on real data of image captioning, to demonstrate the relationship between RAML and the proposed softmax Q-distribution estimation, verifying our theoretical analysis. Additional experiments on three structured prediction tasks with rewards defined on sequential (named entity recognition), tree-based (dependency parsing) and irregular (machine translation) structures show notable improvements over maximum likelihood baselines.","pdf":"/pdf/aaac932bf9c29da11d034a38441cfea712b8527e.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|softanonymousx_qdistribution_estianonymoustion_for_structured_prediction_a_theoretical_interpretation_for_raml","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018softmax,          \ntitle={Softmax Q-Distribution Estimation for Structured Prediction: A Theoretical Interpretation for RAML},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper271/Authors"],"keywords":["structured prediction","RAML","theory","Bayes decision rule","reward function"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509085428480,"tcdate":1509085428271,"number":270,"cdate":1509085428271,"id":"rkhlb8lCZ","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"rkhlb8lCZ","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Wavelet Pooling for Convolutional Neural Networks","abstract":"Convolutional Neural Networks continuously advance the progress of 2D and 3D image and object classification.

Therefore, a large-capacity model with early-stopping stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as implicit regularizer seems to be the best choice, as it has better generalization ability and higher convergence speed.","pdf":"/pdf/c25bc54d3f3e94c3080b74e7725966d0c46d7dd4.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|empirical_investigation_on_model_capacity_and_generalization_of_neural_networks_for_text","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018empirical,          \ntitle={Empirical Investigation on Model Capacity and Generalization of Neural Networks for Text},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper265/Authors"],"keywords":["Text","Empirical Investigation","Model Capacity","Generalization Ability","Neural Networks","Deep Learning"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509288254791,"tcdate":1509084292247,"number":264,"cdate":1509084292247,"id":"rknt2Be0-","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"rknt2Be0-","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Multi-Agent Compositional Communication Learning from Raw Visual Input","abstract":"One of the distinguishing natures of human language is its compositionality, which allows us to describe the complex environment with limited vocabulary.

In this work, we train neural network agents to communicate in compositional language based only on raw image pixels.

Furthermore, such methods have only been shown to be reliable for relatively simple human motions, such as walking or running. In contrast, our approach can synthesize arbitrary motions with highly complex styles, including dances or martial arts in addition to locomotion. The acLSTM is able to accomplish this by explicitly accommodating for autoregressive noise accumulation during training. Furthermore, the structure of the acLSTM is modular and compatible with any other recurrent network architecture, and is usable for tasks other than motion.

In typical applications, decoders are constructed for individual subjects and with limited data leading to restrictions on the types of models that can be utilized. Currently, the best performing decoders are typically linear models capable of utilizing rigid timing constraints with limited training data. Here we demonstrate the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to take advantage of the temporal information present in sequential neural data collected from subjects implanted with electrocorticographic (ECoG) electrode arrays performing a finger flexion task. Our constructed models are capable of achieving accuracies that are comparable to existing techniques while also being robust to variation in sample data size. Moreover, we utilize the LSTM networks and an affine transformation layer to construct a novel architecture for transfer learning. We demonstrate that in scenarios where only the affine transform is learned for a new subject, it is possible to achieve results comparable to existing state-of-the-art techniques. The notable advantage is the increased stability of the model during training on novel subjects. Relaxing the constraint of only training the affine transformation, we establish our model as capable of exceeding performance of current models across all training data sizes. Overall, this work demonstrates that LSTMs are a versatile model that can accurately capture temporal patterns in neural data and can provide a foundation for transfer learning in neural decoding.","pdf":"/pdf/6f2f7deab4987cbc31d764b87984e186372d621e.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|sequence_transfer_learning_for_neural_decoding","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018sequence,          \ntitle={Sequence Transfer Learning for Neural Decoding},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper259/Authors"],"keywords":["Transfer Learning","Applications","Neural decoding"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509083202751,"tcdate":1509083202560,"number":258,"cdate":1509083202560,"id":"SJiHOSeR-","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"SJiHOSeR-","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Contextual memory bandit for pro-active dialog engagement","abstract":"An objective of pro-activity in dialog systems is to enhance the usability of conversational\nagents by enabling them to initiate conversation on their own.

However, DenseNet's extreme connectivity pattern may hinder its scalability to high depths, and in applications like fully convolutional networks, full DenseNet connections are prohibitively expensive. \nThis work first experimentally shows that one key advantage of skip connections is to have short distances among feature layers during backpropagation. Specifically, using a fixed number of skip connections, the connection patterns with shorter backpropagation distance among layers have more accurate predictions. Following this insight, we propose a connection template, Log-DenseNet, which, in comparison to DenseNet,  only slightly increases the backpropagation distances among layers from 1 to  ($1 + \\log_2 L$), but uses only $L\\log_2 L$ total connections instead of $O(L^2)$. Hence, Log-DenseNets are easier than DenseNets to implement and to scale.

We show that this class of tasks are much more challenging than previously studied tasks, and the test accuracy of existing approaches is almost 0%.\n\nWe tackle the challenges by developing three novel techniques inspired by three novel observations, which reveal the key ingredients of using deep learning to synthesize a complex program. First, the use of a non-differentiable machine is the key to effectively restrict the search space. Thus our proposed approach learns a neural program operating a domain-specific non-differentiable machine. Second, recursion is the key to achieve generalizability. Thus, we bake-in the notion of recursion in the design of our non-differentiable machine. Third, reinforcement learning is the key to learn how to operate the non-differentiable machine, but it is also hard to train the model effectively with existing reinforcement learning\nalgorithms from a cold boot. We develop a novel two-phase reinforcement learning-based search algorithm to overcome this issue. In our evaluation, we show that using our novel approach, neural parsing programs can be learned to achieve 100% test accuracy on test inputs that are 100\u0002 longer than the training samples.","pdf":"/pdf/f6856441c5013ff1d39df20dd1ddd97fd2573eb5.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|towards_synthesizing_complex_programs_from_inputoutput_examples","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018towards,          \ntitle={Towards Synthesizing Complex Programs From Input-Output Examples},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper252/Authors"],"keywords":[]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509130073354,"tcdate":1509081975018,"number":251,"cdate":1509081975018,"id":"ryJYmreCZ","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"ryJYmreCZ","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":" A Matrix Approximation View of NCE that Justifies Self-Normalization","abstract":"Self-normalizing discriminative models approximate the normalized probability of a class without having to compute the partition function.

Toward solving the problem, the de facto approach is to employ a sequence-to-sequence-style model. Such an approach will necessarily require the SQL queries to be serialized. Since the same SQL query may have multiple equivalent serializations, training a sequence-to-sequence-style model is sensitive to the choice from one of them. This phenomenon is documented as the \"order-matters\" problem. Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on reinforcement learning to reward the decoder when it generates any of the equivalent serializations. However, we observe that the improvement from reinforcement learning is limited.\n    \nIn this paper, we propose a novel approach, i.e., SQLNet, to fundamentally solve this problem by avoiding the sequence-to-sequence structure when the order does not matter. In particular, we employ a sketch-based approach where the sketch contains a dependency graph, so that one prediction can be done by taking into consideration only the previous predictions that it depends on. In addition, we propose a sequence-to-set model as well as the column attention mechanism to synthesize the query based on the sketch. By combining all these novel techniques, we show that SQLNet can outperform the prior art by 9% to 13% on the WikiSQL task.","pdf":"/pdf/aca3047246322a6eb3a9f2222798202f304b722a.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|sqlnet_generating_structured_queries_from_natural_language_without_reinforcement_learning","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018sqlnet:,          \ntitle={SQLNet: Generating Structured Queries From Natural Language Without Reinforcement Learning},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper247/Authors"],"keywords":[]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509139025171,"tcdate":1509080959551,"number":246,"cdate":1509080959551,"id":"SyOK1Sg0W","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"SyOK1Sg0W","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Adaptive Quanization of Neural Networks","abstract":"Despite the state-of-the-art accuracy of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in various classification problems, their deployment onto resource constrained edge computing devices remains challenging, due to their large size and complexity.

However, these studies usually do not consider the change in loss when performing quantization, nor do they take the disparate importance of DNN connections to the accuracy into account. We address these issues in this paper by proposing a new method, called adaptive quantization, which simplifies a trained DNN model by finding a unique, optimal precision for each connection weight such that the increase in loss is minimized. The optimization problem at the core of this method iteratively uses the loss function gradient to determine an error margin for each weight and assign it a precision accordingly. Since this problem uses linear functions, it is computationally cheap and, as we will show, has a closed-form approximate solution.

Recent work has shown that it is possible to address these issues by using recursion in the Neural Programmer-Interpreter, but this technique requires a verification set which is difficult to construct without knowledge of the internals of the oracle used to generate training data. In this work, we show how to automatically build such a verification set, which can also be directly used for training.

We propose a simple way to resolve this issue by decoupling the weight decay and the optimization steps taken w.r.t. the loss function. We provide empirical evidence that the proposed decoupling (i) decouples the optimal choice of weight decay factor from the setting of the learning rate for both standard SGD and Adam, and (ii) substantially improves Adam's generalization performance, allowing it to compete with SGD with momentum on image classification datasets (on which it was previously typically outperformed by the latter). We also demonstrate that longer optimization runs require smaller weight decay values for optimal results and introduce a normalized variant of weight decay to reduce this dependence.

Our network, which we call SpectralNet, learns a map that embeds input data points into the eigenspace of their associated graph Laplacian matrix and subsequently clusters them. We train SpectralNet using a procedure that involves constrained stochastic optimization. Stochastic optimization allows it to scale to large datasets, while the constraints, which are implemented using a special purpose output layer, allow us to keep the network output orthogonal. Moreover, the map learned by SpectralNet naturally generalizes the spectral embedding to unseen data points. To further improve the quality of the clustering, we replace the standard pairwise Gaussian affinities with affinities leaned from unlabeled data using a Siamese network.  Additional improvement can be achieved by applying the network to code representations produced, e.g., by standard autoencoders. Our end-to-end learning procedure is fully unsupervised. In addition, we apply VC dimension theory to derive a lower bound on the size of  SpectralNet.

Most common explicit regularization techniques, such as dropout and weight decay, reduce the effective capacity of the model and typically require the use of deeper and wider architectures to compensate for the reduced capacity. Although these techniques have been proven successful in terms of results, they seem to waste capacity.

These networks often have a large number of parameters and thus require much data to train. When the number of training data points is small, however, a network with high flexibility will quickly overfit the training data, resulting in a large model variance and a poor generalization performance. To address this problem, we propose a new ensemble learning method called InterBoost for small-sample image classification. In the training phase, InterBoost first randomly generates two complementary datasets to train two base networks of the same structure, separately, and then next two complementary datasets for further training the networks are generated through interaction (or information sharing) between the two base networks trained previously. This interactive training process continues iteratively until a stop criterion is met. In the testing phase, the outputs of the two networks are combined to obtain one final score for classification.

Second, discriminators of GANs easily forget about past generated samples by generators, incurring instability during adversarial training. We argue that these two infamous problems of unsupervised GANs can be largely alleviated by a memory structure to which both generators and discriminators can access. Generators can effectively store a large amount of training samples that are needed to understand the underlying cluster distribution, which eases the structure discontinuity problem. At the same time, discriminators can memorize previously generated samples, which mitigate the forgetting problem. We propose a novel end-to-end GAN model named memoryGAN, that involves a memory network that can be trained in an unsupervised manner, and integrable to many existing models of GANs. With evaluations on multiple datasets including Fashion-MNIST, CelebA, CIFAR10, and Chairs, we show that our model is probabilistically interpretable, and generates image samples of high visual fidelity.

The setup is as follows: given an episodic task and a finite number of off-policy RL algorithms, a meta-algorithm has to decide which RL algorithm is in control during the next episode so as to maximize the expected return. The article presents a novel meta-algorithm, called Epochal Stochastic Bandit Algorithm Selection (ESBAS). Its principle is to freeze the policy updates at each epoch, and to leave a rebooted stochastic bandit in charge of the algorithm selection. Under some assumptions, a thorough theoretical analysis demonstrates its near-optimality considering the structural sampling budget limitations.

ESBAS is then adapted to a true online setting where algorithms update their policies after each transition, which we call SSBAS.

However, since reparameterization trick only works on continuous variables, deep generative models with discrete latent variables still remain hard to train and perform considerably worse than their continuous counterparts. In this paper, we attempt to shrink this gap by introducing a new architecture and its learning procedure.  We develop a hybrid generative model with binary latent variables that consists of an undirected graphical model and a deep neural network. We propose an efficient two-stage pretraining and training procedure that is crucial for learning these models.

In contrast to classification, where only a limited number of distinct classes is given, the regression task is defined as predicting continuous labels for a given dataset. Semi-supervised learning is of vital importance for the applications where a small number of labeled samples is available, or labeling samples is difficult or expensive to collect. A case in point is autonomous driving in which obtaining sufficient labeled samples covering all driving conditions is costly. In this context, we can take advantage of semi-supervised learning techniques with groundbreaking generative models, such as generative adversarial networks. However, almost all proposed GAN-based semi-supervised techniques in the literature are focused on solving the classification problem. Hence, developing a GAN-based semi-supervised method for the regression task is still an open problem. In this work, two different architectures will be proposed to address this problem. In summary, our introduced method is able to predict continuous labels for a training dataset which has only a limited number of labeled samples. Moreover, the application of this technique for solving the end-to-end task in autonomous driving will be presented.  \nWe performed several experiments over a publicly available driving dataset to evaluate our proposed method, and the results are very promising.

In this paper, we draw inspiration from the recent success of sequence-to-sequence models for structured prediction problems to develop policies over discretized spaces. Central to this method is the realization that complex functions over high dimensional spaces can be modeled by neural networks that predict one dimension at a time. Specifically, we show how Q-values and policies over continuous spaces can be modeled using a next step prediction model over discretized dimensions.

While it is notable that models with no meaningful prior knowledge overcome these learning obstacles, AI researchers and practitioners currently lack a clear understanding of exactly how they do so. Here we address this question as a way of achieving a clearer general understanding of grounded language learning, both to inform future research and to improve confidence in model predictions. For maximum control and generality, we focus on a simple neural network-based language learning agent trained via policy-gradient methods to interpret synthetic linguistic instructions in a simulated 3D world. We apply experimental paradigms from developmental psychology to this agent, exploring the conditions under which established human biases and learning effects emerge.

In this paper, we advocate to broadcast every sentence pair as two groups of similar sentences to incorporate more diversity in language expressions, which we name as parallel cluster. Then we define a more general cluster-to-cluster correspondence score and train our model to maximize this score. Since direct maximization is difficult, we derive its lower-bound as our surrogate objective, which is found to generalize point-point Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and point-to-cluster Reward Augmented Maximum Likelihood (RAML) algorithms as special cases.

The latent representations of images are DNA-like, in which each individual piece represents an independent factor of variation. By annihilating the recessive piece and swapping a certain piece of two latent representations, we obtain another two different representations which could be decoded into images.

One way to construct flexible variational distribution is to warp a simple density into a complex by normalizing flows, where the resulting density can be analytically evaluated. However, there is a trade-off between the flexibility of normalizing flow and computation cost for efficient transformation.

Despite their promising performances on many tasks, CNNs still face major obstacles on the road to achieving ideal machine intelligence. One is the difficulty of interpreting them and understanding their inner workings, which is important for diagnosing their failures and correcting them. Another is that standard CNNs require large amounts of annotated data, which is sometimes very hard to obtain. Hence, it is desirable to enable them to learn from few examples. In this work, we address these two limitations of CNNs by developing novel and interpretable models for few-shot learning. Our models are based on the idea of encoding objects in terms of visual concepts, which are interpretable visual cues represented within CNNs. We first use qualitative visualizations and quantitative statistics, to uncover several key properties of feature encoding using visual concepts. Motivated by these properties, we present two intuitive models for the problem of few-shot learning. Experiments show that our models achieve competitive performances, while being much more flexible and interpretable than previous state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods.

However, the governing equations for many complex systems in modern applications are still not fully known. With the rapid development of sensors, computational power, and data storage in the past decade, huge quantities of data can be easily collected and efficiently stored. Such vast quantity of data offers new opportunities for data-driven discovery of hidden physical laws. Inspired by the latest development of neural network designs in deep learning, we propose a new feed-forward deep network, called PDE-Net, to fulfill two objectives at the same time: to accurately predict dynamics of complex systems and to uncover the underlying hidden PDE models. The basic idea of the proposed PDE-Net is to learn differential operators by learning convolution kernels (filters), and apply neural networks or other machine learning methods to approximate the unknown nonlinear responses. Comparing with existing approaches, which either assume the form of the nonlinear response is known or fix certain finite difference approximations of differential operators, our approach has the most flexibility by learning both differential operators and the nonlinear responses. A special feature of the proposed PDE-Net is that all filters are properly constrained, which enables us to easily identify the governing PDE models while still maintaining the expressive and predictive power of the network. These constrains are carefully designed by fully exploiting the relation between the orders of differential operators and the orders of sum rules of filters (an important concept originated from wavelet theory). We also discuss relations of the PDE-Net with some existing networks in computer vision such as Network-In-Network (NIN) and Residual Neural Network (ResNet). Numerical experiments show that the PDE-Net has the potential to uncover the hidden PDE of the observed dynamics, and predict the dynamical behavior for a relatively long time, even in a noisy environment.","pdf":"/pdf/21e36c078c021899092b15982787e2eaf2890789.pdf","TL;DR":"This paper proposes a new feed-forward network, call PDE-Net, to learn PDEs from data.

Yet, from experiments and analysis in this earlier work, it is not clear what strategies are used by these algorithms in navigating the mazes and finding the goal. In this paper, we pose and study this underlying question: are DRL algorithms doing some form of mapping and/or path-planning? Our experiments show that the algorithms are not memorizing the maps of mazes at the testing stage but, rather, at the training stage. Hence, the DRL algorithms fall short of qualifying as mapping or path-planning algorithms with any reasonable definition of mapping. We extend the experiments in Mirowski et al. (2016) by separating the set of training and testing maps and by a more ablative coverage of the space of experiments. Our systematic experiments show that the NavA3C-D1-D2-L algorithm, when trained and tested on the same maps, is able to choose the shorter paths to the goal. However, when tested on unseen maps the algorithm utilizes a wall-following strategy to find the goal without doing any mapping or path planning.","pdf":"/pdf/26b76ad8ba2ec837f85c34fb5afee92eeb953073.pdf","TL;DR":"We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate deep reinforcement learning based navigation methods under a variety of conditions to answer the question of how close they are to replacing classical path planners and mapping algorithms.","paperhash":"anonymous|do_deep_reinforcement_learning_algorithms_really_learn_to_navigate","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018do,          \ntitle={Do Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms really Learn to Navigate?},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper123/Authors"],"keywords":["deep reinforcement learning","navigation","path-planning","mapping"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509041431814,"tcdate":1509011097527,"number":122,"cdate":1509011097527,"id":"SJZsR7kCZ","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"SJZsR7kCZ","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Iterative Deep Compression : Compressing Deep Networks for Classification and Semantic Segmentation","abstract":"Machine learning and in particular deep learning approaches have outperformed many traditional techniques in accomplishing complex tasks such as\nimage classfication, natural language processing or speech recognition.

Its goal is to use gates to control the information flow (e.g., whether to skip some information/transformation or not) in the recurrent computations, although its practical implementation based on soft gates only partially achieves this goal and is easy to overfit. In this paper, we propose a new way for LSTM training, which pushes the values of the gates towards 0 or 1. By doing so, we can (1) better control the information flow: the gates are mostly open or closed, instead of in a middle state; and (2) avoid overfitting to certain extent: the gates operate at their flat regions, which is shown to correspond to better generalization ability. However, learning towards discrete values of the gates is generally difficult. To tackle this challenge, we leverage the recently developed Gumbel-Softmax trick from the field of variational methods, and make the model trainable with standard backpropagation. Experimental results on language modeling and machine translation show that (1) the values of the gates generated by our method are more reasonable and intuitively interpretable, and (2) our proposed method generalizes better and achieves better accuracy on test sets in all tasks. Moreover, the learnt models are not sensitive to low-precision approximation and low-rank approximation of the gate parameters due to the flat loss surface.","pdf":"/pdf/43f39282b4be9f6f8244e5785ab7f01bf5fbd9e0.pdf","TL;DR":"We propose a new algorithm for LSTM training by learning towards binary-valued gates which we shown has many nice properties.","paperhash":"anonymous|towards_binaryvalued_gates_for_robust_lstm_training","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018towards,          \ntitle={Towards Binary-valued Gates for Robust LSTM Training },          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper118/Authors"],"keywords":["recurrent neural network","LSTM","long-short term memory network","machine translation","generalization"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509137505605,"tcdate":1509000784317,"number":117,"cdate":1509000784317,"id":"BJ_UL-k0b","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"BJ_UL-k0b","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Recasting Gradient-Based Meta-Learning as Hierarchical Bayes","abstract":"Meta-learning allows an intelligent agent to leverage prior learning episodes as a\nbasis for quickly improving performance on a novel task.

In medical imaging, encouraging results have been achieved with deep learning for applications such as segmentation, lesion detection and classification. Nearly all of the deep learning based image analysis methods work on reconstructed images, which are obtained from original acquisitions via solving inverse problems (reconstruction). The reconstruction algorithms are designed for human observers, but not necessarily optimized for DNNs which can often observe features that are incomprehensible for human eyes. Hence, it is desirable to train the DNNs directly from the original data which lie in a different domain with the images. In this paper, we proposed an end-to-end DNN for abnormality detection in medical imaging. To align the acquisition with the annotations made by radiologists in the image domain, a DNN was built as the unrolled version of iterative reconstruction algorithms to map the acquisitions to images, and followed by a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect the abnormality in the reconstructed images. The two networks were trained jointly in order to optimize the entire DNN for the detection task from the original acquisitions. The DNN was implemented for lung nodule detection in low-dose chest computed tomography (CT), where a numerical simulation was done to generate acquisitions from 1,018 chest CT images with radiologists' annotations. The proposed end-to-end DNN demonstrated better sensitivity and accuracy for the task compared to a two-step approach, in which the reconstruction and detection DNNs were trained separately. A significant reduction of false positive rate on suspicious lesions were observed, which is crucial for the known over-diagnosis in low-dose lung CT imaging. The images reconstructed by the proposed end-to-end network also presented enhanced details in the region of interest.

These modified layers have weight matrices that are block diagonal, turning a single fully connected layer into a set of densely connected neuron groups. This method condenses network storage and speeds up the run time without significant adverse effect on the testing accuracy, thus offering a new approach to solving the first problem. Comparing the change in variance and singular values of the weights through training in a layer when varying the number of blocks gives insight into the second problem. The ratio of the variance of the weights remains constant throughout training. That is, the relationship in structure is preserved in the final parameter distribution.

This hints at the possibility that the baseline models in these experiments are perhaps severely over-parameterized at the outset and a viable alternative for model compression might be to simply reduce the number of hidden units while maintaining the model's dense connection structure, exposing a similar trade-off in model size and accuracy. We investigate these two distinct paths for model compression within the context of energy-efficient inference in resource-constrained environments and propose a new gradual pruning technique that is simple and straightforward to apply across a variety of models/datasets with minimal tuning and can be seamlessly incorporated within the training process. We compare the accuracy of large, but pruned models (large-sparse) and their smaller, but dense (small-dense) counterparts with identical memory footprint.

In this paper, we propose a channel pruning technique for accelerating the computations of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which does not critically rely on this assumption. Instead, it focuses on direct simplification of the channel-to-channel computation graph of a CNN without the need of performing a computational difficult and not always useful task of making high-dimensional tensors of CNN structured sparse. Our approach takes two stages: the first being to adopt an end-to-end stochastic training method that eventually forces the outputs of some channels being constant, and the second being to prune those constant channels from the original neural network by adjusting the biases of their impacting layers such that the resulting compact model can be quickly fine-tuned. Our approach is mathematically appealing from an optimization perspective and easy to reproduce. We experimented our approach through several image learning benchmarks and demonstrate its interesting aspects and the competitive performance.","pdf":"/pdf/c08fc5bcc6cd301f20476f8c589079174c0314ca.pdf","TL;DR":"A CNN model pruning method using ISTA and rescaling trick to enforce sparsity of scaling parameters in batch normalization.","paperhash":"anonymous|rethinking_the_smallernormlessinformative_assumption_in_channel_pruning_of_convolution_laanonymousrs","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018rethinking,          \ntitle={Rethinking the Smaller-Norm-Less-Informative Assumption in Channel Pruning of Convolution Layers},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper99/Authors"],"keywords":["model pruning","batch normalization","convolutional neural network","ISTA"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509124899591,"tcdate":1508969252434,"number":98,"cdate":1508969252434,"id":"rk3mjYRp-","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"rk3mjYRp-","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Diffusing Policies : Towards Wasserstein Policy Gradient Flows","abstract":"Policy gradients methods often achieve better performance when the change in policy is limited to a small Kullback-Leibler divergence.

Thus we investigate how to improve the classification performance by better adjusting the features. One main observation is that elongating the feature norm of both correctly-classified and mis-classified feature vectors improves learning: (1) increasing the feature norm of correctly-classified examples induce smaller training loss; (2) increasing the feature norm of mis-classified examples can upweight the contribution from hard examples. Accordingly, we propose feature incay to regularize representation learning by encouraging larger feature norm.

We introduce a novel automated countermeasure called Parallel Checkpointing Learners (PCL) to thwart the potential adversarial attacks and significantly improve the reliability (safety) of a victim DL model. The proposed PCL methodology is unsupervised, meaning that no adversarial sample is leveraged to build/train parallel checkpointing learners. We formalize the goal of preventing adversarial attacks as an optimization problem to minimize the rarely observed regions in the latent feature space spanned by a DL network. To solve the aforementioned minimization problem, a set of complementary but disjoint checkpointing modules are trained and leveraged to validate the victim model execution in parallel. Each checkpointing learner explicitly characterizes the geometry of the input data and the corresponding high-level data abstractions within a particular DL layer. As such, the adversary is required to simultaneously deceive all the defender modules in order to succeed. We extensively evaluate the performance of the PCL methodology against the state-of-the-art attack scenarios, including Fast-Gradient-Sign (FGS), Jacobian Saliency Map Attack (JSMA), Deepfool, and Carlini&WagnerL2 algorithm. Extensive proof-of-concept evaluations for analyzing various data collections including MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet corroborate the effectiveness of our proposed defense mechanism against adversarial samples.

This extends previous work on score estimation by denoising autoencoders to the case of a conditional distribution, with a novel use of a corrupted feedforward predictor replacing Gaussian corruption. An advantage of this approach over more classical ways to perform iterative inference for structured outputs, like conditional random fields (CRFs), is that it is not any more necessary to define an explicit energy function linking the output variables. To keep computations tractable, such energy function parametrizations are typically fairly constrained, involving only a few neighbors of each of the output variables in each clique.

The main intuition is to employ multiple generators, instead of using a single one as in the original GAN. The idea is simple, yet proven to be extremely effective at covering diverse data modes, easily overcoming the mode collapsing problem and delivering state-of-the-art results. A minimax formulation was able to establish among a classifier, a discriminator, and a set of generators in a similar spirit with GAN. Generators create samples that are intended to come from the same distribution as the training data, whilst the discriminator determines whether samples are true data or generated by generators, and the classifier specifies which generator a sample comes from. The distinguishing feature is that internal samples are created from multiple generators, and then one of them will be randomly selected as final output similar to the mechanism of a probabilistic mixture model. We term our method Mixture Generative Adversarial Nets (MGAN). We develop theoretical analysis to prove that, at the equilibrium, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between the mixture of generators’ distributions and the empirical data distribution is minimal, whilst the JSD among generators’ distributions is maximal, hence effectively avoiding the mode collapsing problem. By utilizing parameter sharing, our proposed model adds minimal computational cost to the standard GAN, and thus can also efficiently scale to large-scale datasets. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic 2D data and natural image databases (CIFAR-10, STL-10 and ImageNet) to demonstrate the superior performance of our MGAN in achieving state-of-the-art Inception scores over latest baselines, generating diverse and appealing recognizable objects at different resolutions, and specializing in capturing different types of objects by the generators.","pdf":"/pdf/81bf7c75ce44785a1d1843d98b019338da486242.pdf","TL;DR":"We propose a new approach to train GANs with a mixture of generators to overcome the mode collapsing problem.","paperhash":"anonymous|mgan_training_generative_adversarial_nets_with_multiple_generators","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018mixed-generator,          \ntitle={Mixed-Generator Generative Adversarial Nets},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper84/Authors"],"keywords":["GANs","Mode Collapse","Mixture","Jensen-Shannon Divergence","Inception Score","Generator","Discriminator","CIFAR-10","STL-10","ImageNet"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509041440296,"tcdate":1508931683032,"number":83,"cdate":1508931683032,"id":"ryjw_eAaZ","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"ryjw_eAaZ","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Unsupervised Deep Structure Learning by Recursive Dependency Analysis","abstract":"We introduce an unsupervised structure learning algorithm for deep, feed-forward, neural networks.

This results in structures allowing neurons to connect to neurons in any deeper layer skipping intermediate layers. Moreover, neurons in deeper layers encode low-order (small condition sets) independencies and have a wide scope of the input, whereas neurons in the first layers encode higher-order (larger condition sets) independencies and have a narrower scope. Thus, the depth of the network is automatically determined---equal to the maximal order of independence in the input distribution, which is the recursion-depth of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm constructs two main graphical models: 1) a generative latent graph (a deep belief network) learned from data and 2) a deep discriminative graph constructed from the generative latent graph. We prove that conditional dependencies between the nodes in the learned generative latent graph are preserved in the class-conditional discriminative graph. Finally, a deep neural network structure is constructed based on the discriminative graph.

The idea is to make a small student network imitate the target of a large teacher network, then the student network can be competitive to the teacher one. Most previous studies focus on model distillation in the classification task, where they propose different architectures and initializations for the student network. However, only the classification task is not enough, and other related tasks such as regression and retrieval are barely considered. To solve the problem, in this paper, we take face recognition as a breaking point and propose model distillation with knowledge transfer from face classification to alignment and verification. By selecting appropriate initializations and targets in the knowledge transfer, the distillation can be easier in non-classification tasks. Experiments on the CelebA and CASIA-WebFace datasets demonstrate that the student network can be competitive to the teacher one in alignment and verification, and even surpasses the teacher network under specific compression rates. In addition, to achieve stronger knowledge transfer, we also use a common initialization trick to improve the distillation performance of classification. Evaluations on the CASIA-Webface and large-scale MS-Celeb-1M datasets show the effectiveness of this simple trick.","pdf":"/pdf/ba8e0b21d1608274c246e61bac781f2c836e9f2a.pdf","TL;DR":"We take face recognition as a breaking point and propose model distillation with knowledge transfer from face classification to alignment and verification","paperhash":"anonymous|model_distillation_with_knowledge_transfer_from_face_classification_to_alignment_and_verification","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018model,          \ntitle={Model Distillation with Knowledge Transfer from Face Classification to Alignment and Verification},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper78/Authors"],"keywords":["distill","transfer","classification","alignment","verification"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509139000636,"tcdate":1508897285271,"number":77,"cdate":1508897285271,"id":"ry6-G_66b","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"ry6-G_66b","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Active Neural Localization","abstract":"Localization is the problem of estimating the location of an autonomous agent from an observation and a map of the environment.

We propose \"Active Neural Localizer\", a fully differentiable neural network that learns to localize efficiently.

The primary notion for formally reasoning about this phenomenon is expressive efficiency, which refers to a situation where one network must grow unfeasibly large in order to replicate functions of another. To date, expressive efficiency analyses focused on the architectural feature of depth, showing that deep networks are representationally superior to shallow ones. In this paper we study the expressive efficiency brought forth by connectivity, motivated by the observation that modern networks interconnect their layers in elaborate ways. We focus on dilated convolutional networks, a family of deep models delivering state of the art performance in sequence processing tasks. By introducing and analyzing the concept of mixed tensor decompositions, we prove that interconnecting dilated convolutional networks can lead to expressive efficiency. In particular, we show that even a single connection between intermediate layers can already lead to an almost quadratic gap, which in large-scale settings typically makes the difference between a model that is practical and one that is not. Empirical evaluation demonstrates how the expressive efficiency of connectivity, similarly to that of depth, translates into gains in accuracy. This leads us to believe that expressive efficiency may serve a key role in developing new tools for deep network design.","pdf":"/pdf/1f44d08536e8a390a774c33eef37b347b3581132.pdf","TL;DR":"We introduce the notion of mixed tensor decompositions, and use it to prove that interconnecting dilated convolutional networks boosts their expressive power.","paperhash":"anonymous|boosting_dilated_convolutional_networks_with_mixed_tensor_decompositions","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018boosting,          \ntitle={Boosting Dilated Convolutional Networks with Mixed Tensor Decompositions},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper76/Authors"],"keywords":["Deep Learning","Expressive Efficiency","Dilated Convolutions","Tensor Decompositions"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509138215748,"tcdate":1508890214122,"number":75,"cdate":1508890214122,"id":"SJCPLLpaW","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"SJCPLLpaW","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Exploring the Hidden Dimension in Accelerating Convolutional Neural Networks","abstract":"DeePa is a deep learning framework that explores parallelism in all parallelizable dimensions to accelerate the training process of convolutional neural networks.

Previous results used one-dimensional TNs in image recognition, showing limited scalability and a request of high bond dimension. In this work, we train two-dimensional hierarchical TNs to solve image recognition problems, using a training algorithm derived from the multipartite entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA). This approach overcomes scalability issues and implies novel mathematical connections among quantum many-body physics, quantum information theory, and machine learning. While keeping the TN unitary in the training phase, TN states can be defined, which optimally encodes each class of the images into a quantum many-body state. We study the quantum features of the TN states, including quantum entanglement and fidelity. We suggest these quantities could be novel properties that characterize the image classes, as well as the machine learning tasks.

Injecting adversarial inputs during training, known as adversarial training, can improve robustness against one-step attacks, but not for unknown iterative attacks. To address this challenge, we propose to utilize embedding space for both classification and low-level (pixel-level) similarity learning to ignore unknown pixel level perturbation. During training, we inject adversarial images without replacing their corresponding clean images and penalize the distance between the two embeddings (clean and adversarial). This additional regularization encourages two similar images (clean and perturbed versions) to produce the same outputs, not necessarily the true labels, enhancing classifier’s robustness against pixel level perturbation. Next, we show iteratively generated adversarial images easily transfer between networks trained with the same strategy. Inspired by this observation, we also propose cascade adversarial training, which transfers the knowledge of the end results of adversarial training. We train a network from scratch by injecting iteratively generated adversarial images crafted from already defended networks in addition to one-step adversarial images from the network being trained. Experimental results show that cascade adversarial training together with our proposed low-level similarity learning efficiently enhances the robustness against iterative attacks, but at the expense of decreased robustness against one-step attacks. We show that combining those two techniques can also improve robustness under the worst case black box attack scenario.","pdf":"/pdf/290ee2151cabb7545056e1094cd49bf397d7b0ae.pdf","TL;DR":"Cascade adversarial training + low level similarity learning improve robustness against both white box and black box attacks.","paperhash":"anonymous|cascade_adversarial_machine_learning_regularized_with_a_unified_embedding","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018cascade,          \ntitle={Cascade Adversarial Machine Learning Regularized with a Unified Embedding},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper67/Authors"],"keywords":["adversarial machine learning","embedding","regularization","adversarial attack"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509125773164,"tcdate":1508865894741,"number":66,"cdate":1508865894741,"id":"B1ydPgTpW","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"B1ydPgTpW","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Predicting Auction Price of Vehicle License Plate with Deep Recurrent Neural Network","abstract":"In Chinese societies, superstition is of paramount importance, and vehicle license plates with desirable numbers can fetch very high prices in auctions.

This leads to the nonidentifiability of the event times’ distribution parameters, which makes the problem significantly more challenging.\n \nIn this work we introduce a novel Siamese Deep Neural Network architecture that is able to effectively learn from data in the presence of multiple adverse events. The developed architecture measures the distance between covariates to issue pairwise concordant time-dependent risks, in which longer event times are assigned lower risks. Furthermore, our architecture is able to directly optimize an approximation to the C-discrimination index, rather than relying on well-known metrics of cross-entropy etc., and which are not able to capture the unique requirements of survival analysis with competing risks.

Looking at auto-encoders from this signal recovery perspective enables us to have a more coherent view of these techniques. In this paper, in particular, we show that the true hidden representation can be approximately recovered if the weight matrices are highly incoherent with unit $ \\ell^{2} $ row length and the bias vectors takes the value (approximately) equal to the negative of the data mean. The recovery also becomes more and more accurate as the sparsity in hidden signals increases.

The key insight is that, in addition to features, we can transfer similarity information and this is sufficient to learn a similarity function and clustering network to perform both domain adaptation and cross-task transfer learning. We begin by reducing categorical information to pairwise constraints, which only considers whether two instances belong to the same class or not (pairwise semantic similarity). This similarity is category-agnostic and can be learned from data in the source domain using a similarity network. We then present two novel approaches for performing transfer learning using this similarity function. First, for unsupervised domain adaptation, we design a new loss function to regularize classification with a constrained clustering loss, hence learning a clustering network with the transferred similarity metric generating the training inputs. Second, for cross-task learning (i.e., unsupervised clustering with unseen categories), we propose a framework to reconstruct and estimate the number of semantic clusters, again using the clustering network. Since the similarity network is noisy, the key is to use a robust clustering algorithm, and we show that our formulation is more robust than the alternative constrained and unconstrained clustering approaches. Using this method, we first show state of the art results for the challenging cross-task problem, applied on Omniglot and ImageNet. Our results show that we can reconstruct semantic clusters with high accuracy. We then evaluate the performance of cross-domain transfer using images from the Office-31 and SVHN-MNIST tasks and present top accuracy on both datasets.  Our approach doesn't explicitly deal with domain discrepancy. If we combine with a domain adaptation loss, it shows further improvement.","pdf":"/pdf/a2392bb8c92bc279fafa48a1e98c9eaa90cfb2e4.pdf","TL;DR":"A learnable clustering objective to facilitate transfer learning across domains and tasks","paperhash":"anonymous|learning_to_cluster_in_order_to_transfer_across_domains_and_tasks","_bibtex":"@article{          \nanonymous2018learning,          \ntitle={Learning to cluster in order to Transfer across domains and tasks},          \nauthor={Anonymous},          \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},          \nyear={2018}      \n}","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper26/Authors"],"keywords":["transfer learning","similarity prediction","clustering","domain adaptation","unsupervised learning","computer vision","deep learning","constrained clustering"]},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":true,"tags":[],"forumContent":null,"tauthor":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"},{"tddate":null,"ddate":null,"tmdate":1509041454842,"tcdate":1508514629089,"number":25,"cdate":1508514629089,"id":"H1pri9vTZ","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","forum":"H1pri9vTZ","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"],"content":{"title":"Deep Function Machines: Generalized Neural Networks for Topological Layer Expression","abstract":"In this paper we propose a generalization of deep neural networks called deep function machines (DFMs).

This corresponds to a network generalizing itself without any user input layers to break the symmetry, but by communication with adjacent layers. In the layer decoupling limit applicable to residual networks (He et al., 2015), we show that the remnant symmetries that survive the non-linear layers are spontaneously broken based on empirical results. The Lagrangian for the non-linear and weight layers together has striking similarities with the one in quantum field theory of a scalar.

We propose a method called Deep Adaptation Networks (DAN) that constrains newly learned filters to be linear combinations of existing ones. DANs preserve performance on the original task, require a fraction (typically 13%) of the number of parameters compared to standard fine-tuning procedures and converge in less cycles of training to a comparable or better level of performance. When coupled with standard network quantization techniques, we further reduce the parameter cost to around 3% of the original with negligible or no loss in accuracy. The learned architecture can be controlled to switch between various learned representations, enabling a single network to solve a task from multiple different domains.

Variational Autoencoder uses a KL divergence penalty to impose the prior, whereas Adversarial Autoencoder uses generative adversarial networks.  A straightforward modification of Adversarial Autoencoder can be achieved by replacing the adversarial network with maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) network. This replacement leads to a new set of probabilistic autoencoder which is also discussed in our paper.\n\nHowever, an essential challenge remains in both of these probabilistic autoencoders, namely that the only source of randomness at the output of encoder, is the training data itself.  Lack of enough stochasticity can make the optimization problem non-trivial. As a result, they can lead to degenerate solutions where the generator collapses into sampling only a few modes.\n\nOur proposal is to replace the adversary of the adversarial autoencoder by a space of {\\it stochastic} functions. This replacement introduces a a new source of randomness which can be considered as a continuous control for encouraging {\\it explorations}. This prevents the adversary from fitting too closely to the generator and therefore leads to more diverse set of generated samples. Consequently, the decoder serves as a better generative network which unlike MMD nets scales linearly with the amount of data. We provide mathematical and empirical evidence on how this replacement outperforms the pre-existing architectures.
