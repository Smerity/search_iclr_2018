Anonymous authors Paper under double-blind review
ABSTRACT
This work aims to provide comprehensive landscape analysis of empirical risk in deep neural networks (DNNs), including the convergence behavior of its gradient, its stationary points and the empirical risk itself to their corresponding population counterparts, which reveals how various network parameters determine the convergence performance. In particular, for an l-layer linear neural network consisting of di neurons in the i-th layer, we prove the gradient of its empiricalrisk uniformly converges to the one of its population risk, at the rate of O(r2l l maxi dis log(d/l)/n). Here d is the total weight dimension, s is the number of nonzero entries of all the weights and the magnitude of weights per layer is upper bounded by r. Moreover, we prove the one-to-one correspondence of the non-degenerate stationary points between the empirical and population risks and provide convergence guarantee for each pair. We also establish the uniform convergence of the empirical risk to its population counterpart and further derive the stability and generalization bounds for the empirical risk. In addition, we analyze these properties for deep nonlinear neural networks with sigmoid activation functions. We prove similar results for convergence behavior of their empirical risk gradients, non-degenerate stationary points as well as the empirical risk itself. To our best knowledge, this work is the first one theoretically characterizing the uniform convergence of the gradient and stationary points of the empirical risk of DNN models, which benefits the theoretical understanding on how the neural network depth l, the layer width di, the network size d, the sparsity in weight and the parameter magnitude r determine the neural network landscape.
1 INTRODUCTION
Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in many fields, such as computer vision (Hinton et al., 2006; Szegedy et al., 2015; He et al., 2016), natural language processing (Collobert & Weston, 2008; Bakshi & Stephanopoulos, 1993), and speech recognition (Hinton et al., 2012; Graves et al., 2013). However, theoretical understanding on the properties of deep learning models still lags behind their practical achievements (Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2017; Kawaguchi, 2016) due to their high non-convexity and internal complexity. In practice, parameters of deep learning models are learned by minimizing the empirical risk via (stochastic-)gradient descent. Therefore, some recent works (Bartlett & Maass, 2003; Neyshabur et al., 2015) analyzed the convergence of the empirical risk to the population risk, which are however still far from fully understanding the landscape of the empirical risk in deep learning models. Beyond the convergence properties of the empirical risk itself, the convergence and distribution properties of its gradient and stationary points are also essential in landscape analysis. A comprehensive landscape analysis can reveal important information on the optimization behavior and practical performance of deep neural networks, and will be helpful to designing better network architectures. Thus, in this work we aim to provide comprehensive landscape analysis by looking into the gradients and stationary points of the empirical risk. Formally, we consider a DNN model f (w; x, y) : Rd0 О Rdl  R parameterized by w  Rd consisting of l layers (l  2) that is trained by minimizing the commonly used squared loss function over sample pairs {(x, y)}  Rd0 О Rdl from an unknown distribution D, where y is the target output for the sample x. Ideally, the model can find its optimal parameter w by minimizing the

Understanding the convergence behavior of J^n(w) to J (w) is critical to statistical machine learning algorithms. In this work, we aim to go further and characterize the landscape of the empirical risk J^n(w) of deep learning models by analyzing the convergence behavior of its gradient and stationary points to their corresponding population counterparts. We provide analysis for both multi-layer linear
and nonlinear neural networks. In particular, we obtain following new results.

и We establish the uniform convergence of empirical gradient wJ^n(w) to its population counterpart wJ (w). Specifically, when the sample size n is not less than O max(l3r2/(2s log(d/l)), s log(d/l)/l) , with probability at least 1 -  the convergence rate is O(r2l l maxi dis log(d/l)/n), where there are s nonzero entries in the parameter w, the output dimension of the i-th layer is di and the magnitude of the weight parameter of each layer is upper bounded by r. This result implies that as long as the training sample size n is sufficiently large, any stationary point of J^n(w) is also a stationary point of J (w) and vise versa, although both J^n(w) and J (w) are very complex.
и We then prove the exact correspondence of non-degenerate stationary points between J^n(w) and J (w). Indeed, the corresponding non-degenerate stationary points also uniformly
converge to each other at the same convergence rate as the one revealed above with an extra
factor 2/. Here  > 0 accounts for the geometric topology of non-degenerate stationary
points (see Definition 1).

Based on the above two new results, we also derive the uniform convergence of the empirical risk J^n(w) to its population risk J (w), which helps understand the generalization error of deep learning models and stability of their empirical risk. These analyses reveal the role of the depth l of a neural
network model in determining its convergence behavior and performance. Also, the results tell that the width factor maxi di, the nonzero entry number s of weights, and the total network size d are also critical to the convergence and performance. In addition, controlling magnitudes of the parameters
(weights) in DNNs are demonstrated to be important for performance. To our best knowledge, this
work is the first one theoretically characterizing the uniform convergence of empirical gradient and
stationary points in both deep linear and nonlinear neural networks.

2 RELATED WORK
To date, only a few theories have been developed for understanding DNNs which can be roughly divided into following three categories. The first category aims to analyze training error of DNNs. Baum (1988) pointed out that zero training error can be obtained when the last layer of a neural network has more units than training samples. Later, Soudry & Carmon (2016) proved that for DNNs with leaky rectified linear units (ReLU) and a single output, the training error achieves zero at any of their local minima as long as the product of the number of units in the last two layers is larger than the training sample size.
The second category of analysis works (Dauphin et al., 2014; Choromanska et al., 2015a; Kawaguchi, 2016; Tian, 2017) focus on analyzing loss surfaces of DNNs, e.g., how the stationary points are distributed. Those results are helpful to understanding performance difference of large- and small-size networks (Choromanska et al., 2015b). Among them, Dauphin et al. (2014) experimentally verified that a large number of saddle points indeed exist for DNNs. With strong assumptions, Choromanska

et al. (2015a) connected the loss function of a deep ReLU network with the spherical spin-class model and described locations of the local minima. Later, Kawaguchi (2016) proved the existence of degenerate saddle points for deep linear neural networks with squared loss function. They also showed that any local minimum is also a global minimum. By utilizing techniques from dynamical system analysis, Tian (2017) gave guarantees that for two-layer bias-free networks with ReLUs, the gradient descent algorithm with certain symmetric weight initialization can converge to the ground-truth weights globally, if the inputs follow Gaussian distribution. Recently, Nguyen & Hein (2017) proved that for a fully connected network with squared loss and analytic activation functions, almost all the local minima are globally optimal if one hidden layer has more units than training samples and the network structure after this layer is pyramidal. Besides, some recent works, e.g., (Zhang et al., 2016; 2017), tried to alleviate analysis difficulties by relaxing the involved highly nonconvex functions into ones easier.
In addition, some existing works (Bartlett & Maass, 2003; Neyshabur et al., 2015) analyze the generalization performance of a DNN model. Based on the VapnikГChervonenkis (VC) theory, Bartlett & Maass (2003) proved that for a feedforward neural network with one-dimensional output, the best convergence rate of the empirical risk to its population risk on the sample distribution can be bounded by its fat-shattering dimension. Recently, Neyshabur et al. (2015) adopted Rademacher complexity to analyze learning capacity of a fully-connected neural network model with ReLU activation functions and bounded inputs.
However, although gradient descent with backpropagation is the most common optimization technique for DNNs, none of existing works analyzes convergence properties of gradient and stationary points of the DNN empirical risk. For single-layer optimization problems, some previous works analyze their empirical risk but essentially differ from our analysis method. For example, Negahban et al. (2009) proved that for a regularized convex program, the minimum of the empirical risk uniformly converges to the true minimum of the population risk under certain conditions. Gonen & ShalevShwartz (2017) proved that for nonconvex problems without degenerated saddle points, the difference between empirical risk and population risk can be bounded. Unfortunately, the loss of DNNs is highly nonconvex and has degenerated saddle points (Fyodorov & Williams, 2007; Dauphin et al., 2014; Kawaguchi, 2016), thus their analysis results are not applicable. Mei et al. (2017) analyzed the convergence behavior of the empirical risk for nonconvex problems, but they only considered the single-layer nonconvex problems and their analysis demands strong sub-Gaussian and subexponential assumptions on the gradient and Hessian of the empirical risk respectively. Their analysis also assumes a linearity property on gradient which is difficult to hold or verify. In contrast, our analysis requires much milder assumptions. Besides, we prove that for deep networks which are highly nonconvex, the non-degenerate stationary points of empirical risk can uniformly converge to their corresponding stationary points of population risk at the rate of O( s/n) which is faster than the rate O( d/n) for single-layer optimization problems in (Mei et al., 2017). Also, Mei et al. (2017) did not analyze the convergence rate of the empirical risk, stability or generalization error of DNNs as this work.
3 PRELIMINARIES
Throughout the paper, we denote matrices by boldface capital letters, e.g. A. Vectors are denoted by boldface lowercase letters, e.g. a, and scalars are denoted by lowercase letters, e.g. a. We define the r-radius ball as Bd(r) {z  Rd | z 2  r}. To explain the results, we also need the vectorization operation vec(и). It is defined as vec(A) = (A(:, 1); и и и ; A(:, t))  Rst that vectorizes A  RsОt along its columns. We use d = lj=1djdj-1 to denote the total dimension of weight parameters, where dj denotes the output dimension of the j-th layer.
In this work, we consider both linear and nonlinear DNNs. Suppose both networks consist of l layers. We use u(j) and v(j) to respectively denote the input and output of the j-th layer, j = 1, . . . , l.
Deep linear neural networks: The function of the j-th layer is formulated as
u(j) W (j)v(j-1)  Rdj , v(j) u(j)  Rdj , j = 1, и и и , l,
where v(0) = x is the input and W (j)  RdjОdj-1 is the weight matrix of the j-th layer.

Deep nonlinear neural networks: We adopt the sigmoid function as the non-linear activation function. The function within the j-th layer can be written as

u(j) W (j)v(j-1)  Rdj , v(j) hj (u(j)) = ((u(1j)); и и и ; (u(djj)))  Rdj , j = 1, и и и , l,

where u(ij) denotes the i-th entry of u(j) and (и) is the sigmoid function, i.e., (a) = 1/(1 + e-a).

Following the common practice, both DNN models adopt the squared loss function defined as

f (w; x, y)

=

v(l) - y

22, where w

(w(1); и и и ; w(l))



Rd contains all the weight pa-

4 RESULTS FOR DEEP LINEAR NEURAL NETWORKS

We first analyze linear neural network models and present following new results: (1) the uniform convergence of the empirical risk gradient to its population counterpart and (2) the convergence properties of non-degenerate stationary points of the empirical risk. As a corollary, we also derive the uniform convergence of the empirical risk to the population one, which further gives stability and generalization bounds. In the next section, we extend the analysis to non-linear neural network models.
We assume the input datum x is  2-sub-Gaussian and has bounded magnitude, as formally stated in Assumption 1.
Assumption 1. The input datum x  Rd0 has zero mean and is  2-sub-Gaussian, i.e.,

E[exp ( , x )]  exp

12 2



2 2

,   Rd0 .

Besides, the magnitude x is bounded as x 2  rx, where rx is a positive universal constant.

Note that any random vector z consisting of independent entries with bounded magnitude is subGaussian and satisfies Assumption 1 (Vershynin, 2012). Moreover, for such a random z, we have  = z   z 2  rx. Such an assumption on bounded magnitude generally holds for natural data, e.g., images and speech signals. Besides, we assume the weight parameters w(j) of each layer are bounded as w   = {w | w(j)  Bdjdj-1 (rj), j = 1, и и и , l} where rj is a constant. For notational simplicity, we let r = maxj rj. Such an assumption is common (Xu & Mannor, 2012). Here we assume the entry value of y falls in [0, 1]. For any bounded target output y, we can always scale it to satisfy such a requirement.
The results presented for linear neural networks here can be generalized to deep ReLU neural networks by applying the results from Choromanska et al. (2015a) and Kawaguchi (2016), which transform deep ReLU neural networks into deep linear neural networks under proper assumptions.

4.1 UNIFORM CONVERGENCE OF EMPIRICAL RISK GRADIENT

We first analyze the convergence of gradients for the DNN empirical and population risks. To our best knowledge, these results are the first ones giving guarantees on gradient convergence, which help better understand the landscape of DNNs and their optimization behavior. The results are stated blow.

Theorem 1. Suppose Assumption 1 on the input datum x holds and the activation functions in a

deep neural network are linear. Then the empirical gradient uniformly converges to the population

gradient in Euclidean norm. Specifically, there exist two universal constants cg and cg such that
if n  cg max(l3r2rx4/(cqs log(d/l)2 4 log(1/)), s log(d/l)/(l 2)) where cq = max0il di, then

holds with probability at least 1 - , where s denotes the number of nonzero entries of all weight parameters and g = max  r2l-1, r2l-1, rl-1 .

From Theorem 1, one can observe that with an increasingly larger sample size n, the difference between empirical risk and population risk gradients decreases monotonically at the rate of O(1/ n) (up to a log factor). Theorem 1 also characterizes how the depth l contributes to obtaining small difference between the empirical and population risk gradients. Specifically, a deeper neural network needs more training samples to mitigate the difference. Also, due to the factor d, training a network of larger size using gradient descent also requires more training samples. We observe a factor of
maxi di (i.e. cq), which prefers a DNN architecture of balanced layer sizes (without extremely wide layers). This result also matches the trend and empirical performance in deep learning applications advocating deep but thin networks (He et al., 2016; Szegedy et al., 2015).
By observing Theorem 1, imposing certain regularizations on the weight parameters is useful. For example, reducing the number of nonzero entries s encourages sparsity regularization like w 1. The results also suggest not choosing large-magnitude weights w in order for a smaller factor r by adopting regularization like w 22.
Theorem 1 also reveals the point derived from optimizing that the empirical and population risks have similar properties when the sample size n is sufficiently large. For example, an /2-stationary point w~ of J^n(w) is also an -stationary point of J (w) with probability 1 -  if n  c ( g/ )2lcqs log(d/l) with c being a constant. Here -stationary point for a function F means the point w satisfying
wF 2  . Understanding such properties is useful, since in practice one usually computes an -stationary point of J^n(w). These results guarantee the computed point is at most a 2 -stationary point of J (w) and is thus close to the optimum.

4.2 UNIFORM CONVERGENCE OF STATIONARY POINTS

We then proceed to analyze the distribution and convergence properties of stationary points of the DNN empirical risk. Here we consider non-degenerate stationary points which are geometrically isolated and thus unique in local regions. Since degenerate stationary points are not unique in a local region, we cannot expect to establish one-to-one corresponding relationship (see below) between them in empirical risk and population risk.
Definition 1. (Non-degenerate stationary points) (Gromoll & Meyer, 1969) If a stationary point w is said to be a non-degenerate stationary point of J (w), then it satisfies
inf i 2J (w)  ,
i
where i 2J (w) denotes the i-th eigenvalue of the Hessian 2J (w) and  is a positive constant.

Non-degenerate stationary points include local minima/maxima and non-degenerate saddle points, while degenerate stationary points refer to degenerate saddle points. Then we introduce the index of non-degenerate stationary points which can characterize their geometric properties.
Definition 2. (Index of non-degenerate stationary points) (Dubrovin et al., 2012) The index of a symmetric non-degenerate matrix is the number of its negative eigenvalues, and the index of a non-degenerate stationary point w of a smooth function F is simply the index of its Hessian 2F (w).

Suppose that J (w) has m non-degenerate stationary points that are denoted as {w(1), w(2), и и и , w(m)}. We prove following convergence behavior of these stationary points.
Theorem 2. Suppose Assumption 1 on the input datum x holds and the activation functions in a deep neural network are linear. Then if n  ch max(l3r2rx4/(cqs log(d/l)2 4 log(1/)), s log(d/l)/2) where ch is a constant, for k  {1, и и и , m}, there exists a non-degenerate stationary point wn(k) of J^n(w) which corresponds to the non-degenerate stationary point w(k) of J (w) with probability at least 1 - . In addition, wn(k) and w(k) have the same non-degenerate index and they satisfy

wn(k) - w(k)

lcq

s log(dn/l) + log(12/) ,
n

(k = 1, и и и , m)

with probability at least 1 - , where the parameters cq, g, and cg are given in Theorem 1.

Theorem 2 guarantees the one-to-one correspondence between the non-degenerate stationary points of the empirical risk J^n(w) and the popular risk J (w). The distances of the corresponding pairs

5

become smaller as n increases. In addition, the corresponding pairs have the same non-degenerate index. This implies that the corresponding stationary points have the same geometric properties, such as whether they are saddle points. Accordingly, we can develop more efficient algorithms, e.g. escaping saddle points (Ge et al., 2015), since Dauphin et al. (2014) empirically proved that saddle points are usually surrounded by high error plateaus. Also when n is sufficiently large, the properties of stationary points of J^n(w) are similar to the points of the population risk J (w) in the sense that they have exactly matching local minima/maxima and non-degenerate saddle points. By comparing Theorems 1 and 2, we find that the requirement for sample number in Theorem 2 is more restrict, since establishing exact one-to-one correspondence between the non-degenerate stationary points of J^n(w) and J (w) and bounding their uniform convergence rate to each other are more challenging. From Theorems 1 and 2, we also notice that the uniform convergence rate of non-degenerate stationary points has an extra factor 1/. This is because bounding stationary points needs to access not only the gradient itself but also the Hessian matrix. See more details in proof.
Kawaguchi (2016) pointed out that degenerate stationary points indeed exist for DNNs. However, since degenerate stationary points are not isolated, such as forming flat regions, it is hard to establish the unique correspondence for them as for non-degenerate ones. Fortunately, by Theorem 1, the gradients at these points of J^n(w) and J (w) are close. This implies that a degenerate stationary point of J (w) will also give a near-zero gradient for J^n(w), i.e., it is also a stationary point for J^n(w).

4.3 UNIFORM CONVERGENCE, STABILITY AND GENERALIZATION OF EMPIRICAL RISK

Based on the above results, we can derive the uniform convergence of empirical risk to population risk easily. In this subsection, we first give the uniform convergence rate of empirical risk for deep linear neural networks in Theorem 3, and then use this result to derive the stability and generalization bounds for DNNs in Corollary 1.
Theorem 3. Suppose Assumption 1 on the input datum x holds and the activation functions in a deep neural network are linear. Then there exist two universal constants cf and cf such that if n  cf max(l3rx4/(dls log(d/l)2 4 log(1/)), s log(d/l)/( 2dl)), then

sup J^n(w) - J (w)  f cf  max
w

dl r2l, rl

s log(dn/l) + log(8/) n

(2)

holds with probability at least 1 - . Here l is the number of layers in the neural network, n is the sample size and dl is the dimension of the final layer.

From Theorem 3, when n  +, we have |J^n(w) - J (w)|  0. According to the definition of uniform convergence (Vapnik & Vapnik, 1998; Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2010), under the distribution D, the empiricalrisk of a deep linear neural network converges to its population risk uniformly at the rate of O(1/ n). Theorem 3 also explains the roles of the depth l, the network size d, and the
number of nonzero weight parameters s in a DNN model.

Based on VC-dimension techniques, Bartlett & Maass (2003) proved that for a feedforward neural network with polynomial activation functions and one-dimensional output, with probability at least

1 -  the convergence bound satisfies |J^n(w) - inff J (w)|  O( ( log2(n) + log(1/))/n).

Here  is the shattered parameter and can be as large as the VC-dimension of the network model, i.e.

at the order of O(ld log(d)+l2d) (Bartlett & Maass, 2003). Note that Bartlett & Maass (2003) did not

reveal the role of the magnitude of weight in their results. In contrast, our uniform convergence bound

is supw |J^n(w)-J (w)|  O( (s log(dn/l) + log(1/))/n). So our convergence rate is tighter.

Neyshabur et al. (2015) proved that the model with ReLU activation functions

number n. Note that our convergence rate involves r2l since we use squared loss instead of the training error in (Neyshabur et al., 2015). The extra parameters s and d are involved since we consider the parameter space rather than the function hypothesis f in (Neyshabur et al., 2015), which helps people more transparently understand the roles of the network parameters. Besides, the Rademacher complexity cannot be applied to analyzing convergence properties of the empirical risk gradient and stationary points as our techniques.

Based on Theorem 3, we proceed to analyze the stability property of the empirical risk and the
convergence rate of the generalization error in expectation. Let S = {(x(1), y(1)), и и и , (x(n), y(n))} denote the sample set in which the samples are i.i.d. drawn from D. When the optimal solution wn to problem (1) is computed by deterministic algorithms, the generalization error is defined as g = J^n(wn) - J (wn). But one usually employs randomized algorithms, e.g. stochastic gradient descent (SGD), for computing wn. In this case, stability and generalization error in expectation
defined in Definition 3 are more applicable.

Definition 3. (Stability and generalization in expectation) (Vapnik & Vapnik, 1998; Shalev-Shwartz

et al., 2010; Gonen & Shalev-Shwartz, 2017) Assume a randomized algorithm A is employed,

((x(1), y(1)), и и и , (x(n), y(n)))  D and wn = argminw J^n(w) is the empirical risk minimizer

(ERM).

error with convergence rate k under distribution D if we have ESD,A J (wn) - J^n(wn)  k.

Stability measures the sensibility of the empirical risk to the input and generalization error measures the effectiveness of ERM on new data. Generalization error in expectation is especially important for applying DNNs considering their internal randomness, e.g. from SGD optimization. Now we present the results on stability and generalization performance of deep linear neural networks.

Corollary 1. Suppose Assumption 1 on the input datum x holds and the activation functions in a deep neural network are linear. Then with probability at least 1 - , both the stability rate and the
generalization error rate of ERM of a deep linear neural network are at least f :

where fj and fj respectively denote fj(wj ; x(j), y(j)) and fj(wn; x(j), y(j)), and f is defined in Eqn. (2).

According to Corollary 1, both the stability rate and the convergence rate of generalization error are O( f ). This result indicates that deep learning empirical risk is stable and its output is robust to small perturbation over the training data. When n is sufficiently large, small generalization error of DNNs
is guaranteed.

5 RESULTS FOR DEEP NONLINEAR NEURAL NETWORKS
In the above section, we analyze the empirical risk optimization landscape for deep linear neural network models. In this section, we extend our analysis to deep nonlinear neural networks which adopt the sigmoid activation function. Our analysis techniques are also applicable to other third-order differentiable activation functions, e.g., tanh function with different convergence rate. Here we assume the input data are i.i.d. Gaussian variables. Assumption 2. The input datum x is a vector of i.i.d. Gaussian variables from N (0,  2).
Since for any input, the sigmoid function always maps it to the range [0, 1]. Thus, we do not require the input x to have bounded magnitude. Such an assumption is common. For instance, Tian (2017) and Soudry & Hoffer (2017) both assumed that the entries in the input vector are from Gaussian distribution. We also assume w   as in (Xu & Mannor, 2012). Here we also assume that the entry

7

value of the target output y falls in [0, 1]. Similar to the analysis of deep linear neural networks, here we also aim to characterize the empirical risk gradient, stationary points and empirical risk for deep nonlinear neural networks.

5.1 UNIFORM CONVERGENCE OF GRADIENT AND STATIONARY POINTS

Here we analyze convergence properties of gradients of the empirical risk for deep nonlinear neural networks.

Theorem 4. Assume the input sample x obeys Assumption 2 and the activation functions in a deep
neural network are sigmoid functions. Then the empirical gradient uniformly converges to the
population gradient in Euclidean norm. Specifically, there are two universal constants cy and cy such that if n  cy cdl3r2/(s log(d) 22 log(1/)) where cd = max0il di, then with probability at least 1 -

where cr = max(r2/16, r2/16 l-1), and s denotes the nonzero entry number of all weights.

Similar to deep linear neural networks, the layer number l, width di, number of nonzero parameter entries s, network size d and magnitude of weights are all critical to the convergence rate. Also, since there is a factor maxi di in the convergence rate, it is better to avoid choosing an extremely wide layer. Interestingly, when analyzing the representation ability of deep learning, Eldan & Shamir (2016) also suggested non-extreme-wide layers, though the conclusion was derived from a different perspective. By comparing Theorems 1 and 4, one can observe that there is a factor (1/16)l-1 in the convergence rate in Theorem 4. This is because the convergence rate accesses the Lipschitz constant and when we bound it, sigmoid activation function brings the factor 1/16 for each layer.

Now we analyze the non-degenerate stationary points of the empirical risk for deep nonlinear neural networks. Here we also assume that the population risk has m non-degenerate stationary points denoted by {w(1), w(2), и и и , w(m)}.
Theorem 5. Assume the input sample x obeys Assumption 2 and the activation functions in a deep neural network are sigmoid functions. Then if n  cs max cdl3r2/(s log(d) 22 log(1/)) , s log(d/l)/2 where cs is a constant, for k  {1, и и и , m}, there exists a non-degenerate stationary point wn(k) of J^n(w) which corresponds to the non-degenerate stationary point w(k) of J (w) with probability at least 1 - . Moreover, wn(k) and w(k) have the same non-degenerate index and they obey

with probability at least 1 - , where cy, cd and cr are the same parameters in Theorem 4.

According to Theorem 5, there is one-to-one correspondence between the non-degenerate stationary points of J^n(w) and J (w). Also the corresponding pair has the same non-degenerate index, implying they have exactly matching local minima/maxima and non-degenerate saddle points. When n is sufficiently large, the non-degenerate stationary point wn(k) in J^n(w) is very close to its corresponding non-degenerate stationary point w(k) in J (w). As for the degenerate stationary points, Theorem 4 guarantees the gradients at these points of J (w) and J^n(w) are very close to each other.

5.2 UNIFORM CONVERGENCE, STABILITY AND GENERALIZATION OF EMPIRICAL RISK

Here we first give the uniform convergence analysis of the empirical risk and then analyze its stability and generalization.

Theorem 6. Assume the input sample x obeys Assumption 2 and the activation functions in a deep neural network are the sigmoid functions. If n  18l2r2/(s log(d) 22 log(1/)), then

From Theorem 6, we obtain that under the distribution D, the empirical risk of a deep nonlinear neural network converges at the rate of O(1/ n) (up to a log factor). Theorem 6 also gives similar results as Theorem 3, including the inclination of regularization penalty on weight and suggestion on non-extreme-wide layers.

We then establish the stability property and the generalization error of the empirical risk for nonlinear neural networks. By Theorem 6, we can obtain the following results.
Corollary 2. Assume the input sample x obeys Assumption 2 and the activation functions in a deep neural network are sigmoid functions. Then with probability at least 1 - , we have

 n and

ESD,A J (wn) - J^n(wn)

 n,

where n is defined in Eqn. (3). The notations fj and fj here are the same in Corollary 1.

By Corollary 2, we know that both the stability convergence rate and the convergence rate of generalization error are O(1/ n). This result accords with Theorems 8 and 9 in (Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2010) which implies O(1/ n) is the bottleneck of the stability and generalization convergence rate for generic learning algorithms. From this result, we have that if n is sufficiently large, the empirical risk can be expected to be very stable. This also dispels misgivings of the random selection of training samples in practice. Such a result indicates that the deep nonlinear neural network can offer good performance on testing data if it achieves small training error.

6 PROOF ROADMAP

Here we briefly introduce our proof roadmap. Due to space limitation, all the proofs of Theorems 1  6 and Corollaries 1 and 2 as well as technical lemmas are deferred to the supplementary material.

The proofs of Theorems 1 and 4 are similar but essentially differ in some techniques

for bounding probability due to their different assumptions. For explanation simplic-

ity, we define four events: E = {supw J^n(w) - J (w) 2 > t}, E1 =

{supw

1 n

n i=1

f (w, x(i))-f (wkw ,

x(i))

2

1 n

ni=1f (wkw , x(i)) - Ef (wkw , x) 2 > t/3},

> t/3}, E2 = {supwki wNi, i[l] and E3 = {supw Ef (wkw , x)

-Ef (w, x) 2 > t/3}, where wkw = [wk1w ; wk2w ; и и и ; wkl w ] is constructed by selecting wki w 

Rdidi-1 from didi-1 /d-net Ni such that w - wkw 2  . Note that in Theorems 1 and 4, t is

respectively set to g and l. Then we have P(E)  P(E1) + P(E2) + P(E3). So we only need to

separately bound P(E1), P(E2) and P(E3). For P(E1) and P(E3), we use the gradient Lipschitz

constant and the properties of -net to prove P(E1)  /2 and P(E3) = 0, while bounding P(E2)

needs more efforts. Here based on the assumptions, we prove that P(E2) has sub-exponential tail

associated to the sample number n and the networks parameters, and it satisfies P(E2)  /2 with

proper conditions. Finally, combining the bounds of the three terms, we obtain the desired results.

To prove Theorems 2 and 5, we first prove the uniform convergence of the empirical Hessian to its population Hessian. Then, we define such a set D = {w   : J (w) 2 < and infi i 2J (w)  }. In this way, D can be decomposed into countably components, with each component containing either exactly one or zero non-degenerate stationary point. For each
component, the uniform convergence of gradient and the results in differential topology guarantee that if J (w) has no stationary points, then J^n(w) also has no stationary points and vise versa. Similarly, for each component, the uniform convergence of Hessian and the results in differential topology guarantee that if J (w) has a unique non-degenerate stationary point, then J^n(w) also has a unique non-degenerate stationary point with the same index. After establishing exact correspondence
between the non-degenerate stationary points of empirical risk and population risk, we use the
uniform convergence of gradient and Hessian to bound the distance between the corresponding pairs.

We adopt a similar strategy to prove Theorems 3 and 6. Specifically, we divide the event supw|J^n(w)-J (w)| > t into E1, E2 and E3 which have the same forms as their counterparts in the proofs of Theorem 1 with the gradient replaced by the loss function. To prove P(E1)  /2 and P(E3) = 0, we can use the Lipschitz constant of the loss function and the -net properties. The

9

Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2018
remaining is to prove P(E2). We also prove that it has sub-exponential tail associated to the sample number n and the networks parameters and it obeys P(E2)  /2 with proper conditions. Then we utilize the uniform convergence of J^n(w) to prove the stability and generalization bounds of J^n(w) (i.e. Corollaries 1 and 2).
7 CONCLUSION
In this work, we provided theoretical analysis on the landscape of empirical risk optimization for deep linear/nonlinear neural networks with (stochastic-)gradient descent, including the properties of the gradient and stationary points of empirical risk as well as the uniform convergence, stability, and generalization of the empirical risk itself. To our best knowledge, most of the results are new to deep learning community. These results also reveal that the depth l, the nonzero entry number s of all weights, the network size d and the width of a network are critical to the convergence rates. We also prove that the weight parameter magnitude is important to the convergence rate. Indeed, small magnitude of the weights is suggested. All the results are consistent with the widely used network architectures in practice.

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL OF EMPIRICAL RISK LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS FOR UNDERSTANDING DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS
A STRUCTURE OF THIS DOCUMENT
This document gives some other necessary notations and preliminaries for our analysis in Sec. B. Then we prove Theorems 1 3 and Corollary 1 for deep linear neural networks in Sec. C. Then we present the proofs of Theorems 4  6 and Corollary 2 for deep nonlinear neural networks in Sec. D.
In both Sec. C and D, we first present the technical lemmas for proving our final results and subsequently present the proofs of these lemmas. Then we utilize these technical lemmas to prove our desired results. Finally, we give the proofs of other auxiliary lemmas.

B NOTATIONS AND PRELIMINARY TOOLS

Beyond the notations introduced in the manuscript, we need some other notations used in this document. Then we introduce several lemmas that will be used later.

B.1 NOTATIONS

Throughout this document, we use и, и to denote the inner product. A  C denotes the Kronecker product between A and C. Note that A and C in A  C can be matrices or vectors. For a matrix

A  Rn1Оn2 , we use A F =

i,j A2ij to denote its Frobenius norm, where Aij is the (i, j)-th

entry of A. We use A op = maxi |i(A)| to denote the operation norm of a matrix A  Rn1Оn1 ,

where i(A) denotes the i-th eigenvalue of the matrix A. For a 3-way tensor A  Rn1Оn2Оn3 , its

operation norm is computed as

A op = sup 3 , A = Aijkij k,

 21

i,j,k

where Aijk denotes the (i, j, k)-th entry of A. Also we denote the vectorization of W (j) (the weight matrix of the j-th layer) as
w(j) = vec W (j)  Rdj dj-1 .

We denote Ik as the identity matrix of size k О k.

For notational simplicity, we further define e v(l) - y as the output error vector. Then the squared

loss

is

defined

as

f (w; x, y)

=

1 2

e

22, where w = (w(1); и и и ; w(l))  Rd contains all the weight

parameters.

B.2 TECHNICAL LEMMAS

We first introduce Lemmas 1 and 2 which are respectively used for bounding the 2-norm of a vector and the operation norm of a matrix. Then we introduce Lemmas 3 and 4 which discuss the topology of functions. In Lemma 5, we give the relationship between the stability and generalization of empirical risk.

Lemma 1. (Vershynin, 2012) For any vector x  Rd, its 2-norm can be bounded as

Lemma 3. (Mei et al., 2017) Let D  Rd be a compact set with a C2 boundary D, and f, g : A  R be C2 functions defined on an open set A, with D  A. Assume that for all w  D and all t  [0, 1], tf (w) + (1 - t)g(w) = 0. Finally, assume that the Hessian 2f (w) is
non-degenerate and has index equal to r for all w  D. Then the following properties hold:

(1) If g has no critical point in D, then f has no critical point in D.

(2) If g has a unique critical point w in D that is non-degenerate with an index of r, then f also has a unique critical point w in D with the index equal to r.
Lemma 4. (Mei et al., 2017) Suppose that F (w) :   R is a C2 function where w  . Assume that {w(1), . . . , w(m)} is its non-degenerate critical points and let D = {w   : F (w) 2 <
and infi i 2F (w)  }. Then D can be decomposed into (at most) countably components, with each component containing either exactly one critical point, or no critical point. Concretely, there exist disjoint open sets {Dk}kN, with Dk possibly empty for k  m + 1, such that
D = k=1Dk .

Furthermore, w(k)  Dk for 1  k  m and each Di, k  m + 1 contains no stationary points.

Lemma 5. (Shalev-Shwartz & Ben-David, 2014b; Gonen & Shalev-Shwartz, 2017) Assume that

D is a sample distribution and randomized algorithm A is employed for optimization. Suppose

that ((x(1), y(1)), и и и , (x(n), y(n)))  D and wn = argminw J^n(w). For every j  {1, и и и , n},

where fj and fj respectively denote fj(wj ; x(j), y(j)) and fj(wn; x(j), y(j)).

C PROOFS FOR DEEP LINEAR NEURAL NETWORKS

In this section, we first present the technical lemmas in Sec. C.1 and then we give the proofs of these lemmas in Sec. C.2. Next, we utilize these lemmas to prove the results in Theorems 1 3 and
Corollary 1 in Sec. C.3. Finally, we give the proofs of other lemmas in Sec. C.4.

C.1 TECHNICAL LEMMAS

Here we present the technical lemmas for proving our desired results. For brevity, we also define Bj:s as follows:

Bs:t W (s)W (s-1) и и и W (t)  RdsОdt-1 , (s  t); Bs:t I, (s < t).

Lemma 6. Assume that the activation functions in the deep neural network f (w, x) are linear functions. Then the gradient of f (w, x) with respect to w(j) can be written as

w(j) f (w, x) = (Bj-1:1x)  BlT:j+1 e, (j = 1, и и и , l), where  denotes the Kronecke product. Then we can compute the Hessian matrix as follows:

C.2 PROOFS OF TECHNICAL LEMMAS

To prove the above lemmas, we first introduce some useful results.

Lemma 12. (Rudelson & Vershynin, 2013) Assume that x = (x1; x2; и и и ; xk)  Rk is a random vector with independent components xi which have zero mean and are independent i2-sub-Gaussian variables. Here maxi i2   2. Let A be an k О k matrix. Then we have

Lemma 14. For Bj:t defined in Eqn. (4), we have the following properties:

Bs:t op  Bs:t F  r and where r = rs-t+1  max r, rl and f = rl.

Bl:1 op  Bl:1 F  f ,

Lemma 13 is useful for bounding probability. The two inequalities in Lemma 14 can be obtained by using w(j) 2  r (j = 1, и и и , l). We defer the proofs of Lemmas 13 and 14 to Sec. C.4.2.

C.2.1 PROOF OF LEMMA 6

Proof. When the activation functions are linear functions, we can easily compute the gradient of f (w, x) with respect to w(j):

w(j) f (w, x) = (Bj-1:1x)  BlT:j+1 e, (j = 1, и и и , l),

where  denotes the Kronecker product. Now we consider the computation of the Hessian matrix.

For brevity, let Qs =

where x holds since Bj-1:1x is a vector and for any vector x, we have (x  A)B = x  (AB). y holds because for any four matrices Z1  Z3 of proper sizes, we have (Z1  Z2)  Z3 = Z1  (Z2  Z3). z holds because for any two matrices z1, z2 of proper sizes, we have z1z2T = z1  z2T = z2T  z1.

Then, we consider the case s > t:

w(t)

w(s) f (w, x)

2f (w, x) = w(Tt)w(s)

=

2f (w, x) w(Tt)w(s)

=

(Qse) w(Tt)

vec (Qse) w(Tt)

vec =

QsBl:t+1W (t)Bt-1:1x w(Tt)

vec +

.

Notice,

Similarly,

we

Since

we have

=

Bs-1:1xxT BtT-1:1

 BlT:s+1Bl:t+1

,

15

Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2018

we only need to consider

vec =

(Bs-1:1x)  w(Tt)

BlT:s+1e

vec (Bs-1:1x) BlT:s+1e T = w(Tt)

 =

Bt-1:1xeT Bl:s+1 T  Bs-1:t+1vec wtT

W (t)

= Bt-1:1xeT Bl:s+1 T  Bs-1:t+1.

Therefore, for s > t, by combining the above two terms, we can obtain

w(t) w(s) f (w, x) = BlT:s+1exT BtT-1:1 Bs-1:t+1 + Bs-1:1xxT BtT-1:1  BlT:s+1Bl:t+1 . Then, by similar method, we can compute the Hessian for the case s < t as follows: w(t) w(s)f (w, x) = BtT-1:s+1  Bs-1:1xeT BlT:t+1 + Bs-1:1xxT BtT-1:1  BlT:s+1Bl:t+1 . The proof is completed.

C.2.2 PROOF OF LEMMA 7 Proof. We first prove that v(l), which is defined in Eqn. (5), is sub-Gaussian.
v(l) = W (l) и и и W (1)x = Bl:1x. Then by the convexity in  of exp(t) and Lemma 14, we can obtain

C.2.3 PROOF OF LEMMA 8
Proof. For brevity, let Qj denote w(j) f (w, x). Then, by Lemma 6 we have w(j) f (w) = (Bj-1:1x)  BlT:j+1 e =x (Bj-1:1x)(BlT:j+1e) =y Bj-1:1  BlT:j+1 (x  e) ,
(7)

17

Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2018

where x holds since Bj-1:1x is a vector, and y holds because for any four matrices Z1  Z4 of
proper sizes, we have (Z1Z3)(Z2Z4) = (Z1Z2)(Z3Z4). Note that e = v(l)-y = Bl:1x-y. Then we know that the i-th entry Qij has the form Qji = p,q zpijqxpxq + p ypijxp + rij (Step 1 blow will give the detailed analysis) where xp denotes the p-th entry in x. Note that zpijq, ypij and rij are constants and independent on x.

We divide   R

l j=1

dj

dj-1

into



=

(1; и и и

; l)

where

j



Rdj dj-1 .

Let

ji

denote

the

i-th

entry in j. Accordingly, we have

l
E , wf (w, x) - Ewf (w, x) = j, Qj - EQj = E1 + E2 + E3,
j=1

where E1, E2, and E3 are defined as

E1=

 l dj dj-1



 ij zpijq (xpxq - Expxq) , E2 =

 l dj dj-1



 ij zpijp x2p - Exp2 ,

p,q:p=q j=1 i=1

p j=1 i=1

 l dj dj-1



E3 = 

ji ypij  (xp - Exp) .

p j=1 i=1

(8)

Thus, we can further separate the event as:

P (E > t)  P

E2k

.

Thus, to prove our conclusion, we can respectively establish the upper bounds of the three events.

To the end, for each input sample x(i), we divide its corresponding Qj - EQj into E1, E2 and
E3. Then we bound the three events separately. Before that, we first give several equalities. Since Bj:s = W (j)W (j-1) и и и W (s) (j  s), by Lemma 14 we have

r2.

Step 1. Divide Qj - EQj: Note that e = v(l) - y = Bl:1x - y. Let Hj = Bj-1:1  BlT:j+1. Then we can further write Eqn. (7) as

Qj = w(j) f (w) = Hj (x  (Bl:1x) - x  y) = Hj ((Id0  Bl:1) (x  x) - x  y) , (10)

where Id0  Rd0Оd0 is the identity matrix. According to Eqn. (10), we can write the i-th entry of Qj as the form Qji = p,q zpijqxpxq + p ypijxp + rij where xp denotes the p-th entry in x. Let Zj = Hj (Id0  Bl:1)  R .djdj-1Оd20 Then, we know that the i-th entry Qij = Z(i, :)x , where x = x  x = [x1x; x2x; и и и , xd0 x]  Rd02 . In this way, we have zpijq = Zj(i, (p - 1)d0 + q) which further implies

where cq = max0il di.

We divide the i-th row Hj(i, :) into Hj(i, :) = [Hj1i, Hj2i, и и и , Hjdi0 ] where Hjpi  R1Оdl . Then we have ypij = yT Hjpi. This yields

Let ji denote the i-th entry of j. Then, by Eqn. (8), we can obtain

Note that for any four matrices of proper sizes, we have (Q1 Q2)(Q3 Q4) = (Q1Q3)(Q2Q4), indicating Zj = Bj-1:1  BlT:j+1 (Id0  Bl:1) = Bj-1:1  BlT:j+1Bl:1 . This gives

C.2.4 PROOFS OF LEMMA 9

Bs-1:1xxT BtT-1:1



BlT:s+1Bl:t+1

, if s < t.

20

Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2018

Then we know that the (i, k)-th entry Qtiks has the form Qtiks = p,q zpikqxpxq + p ypikxp + rik (explained in the following Step 1. I) where xp denotes the p-th entry in x. Note that zpikq, ypik and rik are constant and independent on x. For convenience, we let Qts = Hts + Gts, where Gts = Bs-1:1xxT BtT-1:1  BlT:s+1Bl:t+1 and Hts is defined as

 

BlT:s+1exT BtT-1:1

 Bs-1:t+1,

Hts = 0,

 BtT-1:s+1  Bs-1:1xeT BlT:t+1 ,

if s > t, if s = t, if s < t.

Let

j=1

j=1 t,s

Then we divide the event as two events:

P (E > t) = P (Eh + Eg > t)  P (Eh > t/2) + P (Eg > t/2) .

Now we look each event separately. Similar to Qts, the (i, k)-th entry Htisk has the form Htisk = p,q zpikqxpxq + p ypikxp + rik. We divide the unit vector   Rd as  = (1; и и и ; l) where
j  Rdjdj-1 . For input vector x, let t,s t, (Hts - E(Hts)) s = Eh1 + Eh2 + Eh3, where





Eh1=



(itsk)zpikq(xpxq -Expxq) , Eh2 = 

(itsk)zpikq xp2 -Exp2 ,

p,q:p=q t,s i,k

p t,s i,k



Eh3 = 

(tisk)ypik (xp - Exp) ,

p t,s i,k

(16)

where xp denotes the p-th entry in x and ji denotes the i-th entry of j. Let Ehj1 , Ehj2 , and Ehj3 denote the Eh1 , Eh2 , and Ehj3 of the j-th sample. Thus, considering n samples, we can further separately divide the two events above as:

To achieve our goal, for each input sample x(i), we divide its corresponding t,s(Hts - EHts)

I. Divide Hts - EHts: For t = s, we can write the (i, k)-th entry Htisk as the form Htisk = p,q zpikqxpxq + p ypikxp + rik. Now we try to bound zpikq and ypik. We first consider the case s < t.
Note that e = v(l) - y = Bl:1x - y. Specifically, we have

Hts = BtT-1:s+1  Bs-1:1xxT BlT:1BlT:t+1 - Bs-1:1xyT BlT:t+1 .

So the (i , k )-th entry in the matrix Bs-1:1xxT BlT:1BlT:t+1 is [Bs-1:1xxT BlT:1BlT:t+1]i k = (Bs-1:1)(i , :)x(Bl:1Bl:t+1)(k , :)x = xT ((Bs-1:1)(i , :))T (Bl:1Bl:t+1)(k , :)x, where A(i , :)
denotes the i -th row of A. Let ii = mod(i, ds), kk = mod(k, dt-1), ii = i/ds and kk = k/dt-1 . In this case, the (i, k)-th entry Htisk = [Bt-1:s+1]kk ii xT ((Bs-1:1)(ii, : ))T (Bl:1Bl:t+1)(kk, :)x + [Bt-1:s+1]kk ii yT (Bl:t+1)(kk, :)T (Bs-1:1)(ii, :)x. Therefore, we have

To achieve our goal, for each input sample x(i), we also divide its

corresponding t,s(Gts - EGts) as Eh1, Eh2 and Eh3. Then we bound the three events separately.

Before that, we first give several equalities.

I. Divide Gts - EGts: Dividing Gts - EGts is more easy than dividing Hts - EHts since the later has more complex form. Since Gts = Bs-1:1xxT BtT-1:1  BlT:s+1Bl:t+1 . we also can write the (i, k)-th entry Gtiks as the form Gitks = p,q zpikqxpxq + p ypikxp + rik. But here ypik = 0.

Then similar to the step in dividing Hts - EHts, we can bound

a2pq  gl2 and

ap2q  gl2 where g = r4(l-1).

II. Bound P(Eg1 > t/6), P(Eg2 > t/6) and P(Eg3 > t/6): Since ypik = 0, P(Eh3 > t/6) = 0. Similar to the above methods, we can bound

Then we consider wf (w, x). Firstly, by Lemma 6 we can bound

Notice, y is the label of sample and the weight magnitude r is usually lager than 1. Then we have y 2  rl. Also, the values in input data are usually smaller than rl. Thus, we have

where ct is a constant. Then we use the inequality 2f (w, x) op  2f (w, x) F to bound 2f (w, x) op. Next we only need to give the upper bound of 2f (w, x) F . Let f2 = rl-2.
We first consider Qst w(s) w(t) f (w, x) . By Lemma 6, if s < t, we have

On the other hand, if the activation functions are linear functions, f (w, x) is fourth order differentiable when l  2. This means that x3wf (w, x) exists. Also since for any input x  Bd0 (rx) and w  , we can always find a universal constant p such that

3wf (w, x) op = sup 3 , 3wf (w, x) = [3wf (w, x)]ijkijk  p < +.

We complete the proofs.

C.2.6 PROOF OF LEMMA 11

Proof. Recall that the weight of each layer has magnitude bound separately, i.e. w(j) 2  r.

Assume that w(j) has sj non-zero entries. Then we have

l j=1

sj

=

s.

So

here

we

separately

assume

wj = {w1j, и и и , wnj j } is the djdj-1 /d-covering net of the ball Bdjdj-1 (r) which corresponds

25

Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2018

to the weight w(j) of the j-th layer. Let n j be the /l-covering number. By -covering theory in (Vershynin, 2012), we can have

nj

dj dj-1 sj

3r sj  exp
dj dj-1 /d

sj log

3rdj dj-1 dj dj-1 /d

3rd = exp sj log

.

Let w   be an arbitrary vector. Since w = [w(1), и и и , w(l)] where w(j) is the weight of the j-th
layer, we can always find a vector wkjj in wj such that w(j) - wkjj 2  djdj-1 /d. For brevity, let jw  [n j] denote the index of wkjj in -net wj. Then let wkw = [wkj1 ; и и и ; wkjj ; и и и ; wkjl ]. This means that we can always find a vector wkw such that w - wkw 2  . Now we use the decomposition strategy to bound our goal:

2J^n(w) - 2J (w) op

=

1 n

n

2f (w, x(i)) - E(2f (w, x))

i=1 op

1n =

+ E(2f (wkw , x)) - E(2f (w, x)) . op

Here we also define four events E0, E1, E2 and E3 as

E0 =

2J^n(w) - 2J (w)

E1 = sup w

.

Accordingly, we have

P (E0)  P (E1) + P (E2) + P (E3) .

So we can respectively bound P (E1), P (E2) and P (E3) to bound P (E0). 26

So

Let w   be an arbitrary vector. Since w = [w(1), и и и , w(l)] where w(j) is the weight of the j-th layer, we can always find a vector wkjj in wj such that w(j) - wkjj 2  djdj-1 /d. For brevity, let jw  [n j] denote the index of wkjj in -net wj. Then let wkw = [wkj1 ; и и и ; wkjj ; и и и ; wkjl ]. This means that we can always find a vector wkw such that w - wkw 2  .

C.3.2 PROOF OF THEOREM 2
Proof. Suppose that {w(1), w(2), и и и , w(m)} are the non-degenerate critical points of J (w). So for any w(k), it obeys

inf
i

ik

2J (w(k))

 ,

where ki 2J (w(k)) denotes the i-th eigenvalue of the Hessian 2J (w(k)) and  is a constant. We further define a set D = {w  Rd | J (w) 2  and infi |i 2J (w(k)) |  }. According
to Lemma 4, D = k=1Dk where each Dk is a disjoint component with w(k)  Dk for k  m and Dk does not contain any critical point of J (w) for k  m + 1. On the other hand, by the continuity of J (w), it yields J (w) 2 = for w  Dk. Notice, we set the value of blow which is actually a function related to n.

Then by utilizing Theorem 1, we let sample number n sufficient large such that

sup J^n(w) - J (w)  zg

Assume that b  Rd is a vector and satisfies bT b = 1. In this case, we can bound ik 2J^n(w) for arbitrary w  Dk as follows:

This means that in each set Dk, 2J^n(w) has no zero eigenvalues. Then, combine this and Eqn. (20), by Lemma 3 we know that if the population risk J (w) has no critical point in Dk, then the empirical risk J^n(w) has also no critical point in Dk; otherwise it also holds. By Lemma 3, we can also obtain that in Dk, if J (w) has a unique critical point w(k) with non-degenerate index sk, then J^n(w) also has a unique critical point w(nk) in Dk with the same non-degenerate index sk. The first conclusion is
proved.

Now we bound the distance between the corresponding critical points of J (w) and J^n(w). Assume that in Dk, J (w) has a unique critical point w(k) and J^n(w) also has a unique critical point wn(k). Then, there exists t  [0, 1] such that for any z  Bd(1), we have

C.3.3 PROOF OF THEOREM 3

Proof. Recall that the weight of each layer has magnitude bound separately, i.e. w(j) 2  r.

Assume that w(j) has sj non-zero entries. Then we have

l j=1

sj

=

s.

So

here

we

separately

assume

wj = {w1j, и и и , wnj j } is the djdj-1 /d-covering net of the ball Bdjdj-1 (r) which corresponds

to the weight w(j) of the j-th layer. Let n j be the /l-covering number. By -covering theory in

(Vershynin, 2012), we can have

nj

dj dj-1 sj

3r sj  exp
dj dj-1 /d

sj log

3rdj dj-1 dj dj-1 /d

3rd = exp sj log

.

Let w   be an arbitrary vector. Since w = [w(1), и и и , w(l)] where w(j) is the weight of the j-th
layer, we can always find a vector wkjj in wj such that w(j) - wkjj 2  djdj-1 /d. For brevity, let jw  [n j] denote the index of wkjj in -net wj. Then let wkw = [wkj1 ; и и и ; wkjj ; и и и ; wkjl ]. This means that we can always find a vector wkw such that w - wkw 2  . Now we use the decomposition strategy to bound our goal:

J^n(w) - J (w) =

f (w, x(i)) - E(f (w, x))

i=1

1n 1n

Then, we define four events E0, E1, E2 and E3 as

E0 = E1 = E2 =

Accordingly, we have P (E0)  P (E1) + P (E2) + P (E3) .
So we can respectively bound P (E1), P (E2) and P (E3) to bound P (E0).

Step 1. Bound P (E1): We first bound P (E1) as follows:

D PROOFS FOR DEEP NONLINEAR NEURAL NETWORKS

In this section, we first present the technical lemmas in Sec. D.1. Then in Sec. D.2 we give the proofs of these lemmas. Next, we utilize these technical lemmas to prove the results in Theorems 4  6 and
Corollary 2 in Sec. D.3. Finally, we give the proofs of other lemmas in Sec. D.4.

D.1 TECHNICAL LEMMAS

Here we present the key lemmas and theorems for proving our desired results. For brevity, we define an operation G which maps an arbitrary vector z  Rk into a diagonal matrix G(z)  RkОk with its i-th diagonal entry equal to (zi)(1 - (zi)) in which zi denotes the i-th entry of z. We further define Ai  Rdi-1Оdi as follows:

Ai = (W (i))T G(u(i))  Rdi-1Оdi (i = 1, и и и , l),

(22)

where W (i) is the weight matrix in the i-th layer and u(i) is the linear output of the i-th layer. In this section, we define

Bs:t = AsAs+1 и и и At  Rds-1Оdt , (s  t) and Bs:t = I, (s > t).

Lemma 16. Suppose that the activation function in deep neural network are sigmoid functions. Then the gradient of f (w, x) with respect to w(j) can be formulated as

w(j) f (w, x) = vec G(u(j))Bj+1:l(v(l) - y) (v(j-1))T , (j = 1, и и и , l - 1),

and w(l) f (w, x) = vec

D.2.1 PROOF OF LEMMA 16
Proof. We use chain rule to compute the gradient of f (w, x) with respect to w(j). We first compute several basis gradient. According to the relationship between u(j), v(j), W (j) and f (w, x), we have

v(l) f (w, x) = v(l) - y,

v(i) f (w, x)

=

 u(i+1) v(i)

f (w, x)  u(i+1)

=

(W (i+1))T

f (w, x) u(i+1) ,

u(i) f (w, x)

=

v(i) u(i)

f (w, x) v(i)

=

G(u(i)) f (w, x) , v(i)

u(i) W (i) f (w, x) = w(i)

f (w, x) u(i)

f (w, x) u(i)

T
,

(i = 1, и и и , l - 1),

(i = 1, и и и , l),

(24)

(i = 1, и и и , l).

Then by chain rule, we can easily compute the gradient of f (w, x) with respect to w(j) which is formulated as

T

w(j) f (w, x) = vec v(j-1) G(u(j))Aj+1Aj+2 и и и Al(v(l) - y)

, (j = 1, и и и , l - 1),

and

T

w(l) f (w, x) = vec v(l-1) G(u(l))(v(l) - y)

.

Besides, since the values in v(l) belong to the range [0, 1]. Combine with Lemma 22, we can bound wf (w, x) 2 as follows:

w(j) f (w, x)

D.2.2 PROOF OF LEMMA 17

For convenience, we first give the computation of some gradients.
Lemma 23. Assume the activation functions in deep neural network are sigmoid functions. Then the following properties hold:

(1)

We

can

compute

the

gradients

f (w,x)  u(i)

and

f (w,x)  v (i)

as

f (w, x) u(i)

=

G(u(i))Bi+1:l(v(l)

- y)

and

f (w, x) v(i)

=

Bi+1:l(v(l)

-

y).

(2)

We

can

compute

the

gradient

 u(i)  w(j )

as

u(i) = (v(j-1))T  w(j)

G(u(j))Bj+1:i-1(W (i))T

u(i) w(i)

= (v(i-1))T

 v (i)  w(j )

as

v(i) = (v(j-1))T  w(j)

T
G(u(j))Bj+1:i  R ,diОdjdj-1 (i  j).

It should be pointed out that the proof of Lemma 23 can be founded Sec. D.4.

Proof. To prove our conclusion, we have two steps: computing the Hessian and bounding its operation norm.

Step

1.

Compute

the

Hessian:

We

first

consider

the

computation

of

:2f (w,x)
 w(Ti)  w(j )

2f (w, x)  vec w(Ti)w(j) =

G(u(j))Aj+1Aj+2 и и и Al(v(l) - y) (v(j-1))T w(Ti)

.

Recall that we define

Bs:t = AsAs+1 и и и At  Rds-1Оdt , (s  t) and Bs:t = I, (s > t).

Then we have

2f (w, x) w(Ti)w(j) =

Case

I:

i

>

j.

We

first

consider

the

case

that

i>j.

In

this

is

case,

Qi1j = 0

since

vec(G(u(j)))
 w(Ti)

=

0.

Computing

Q2ij

needs

more

efforts.

By

utilizing

the

computation

of

 u(k)  w(i)

in

Lemma

23,

we

have

vec G(u(k)) w(i)

vec G(u(k)) = u(k)

u(k) w(i) = Pk

v(i-1))T 

G(u(i))Bi+1:k-1(W (k))T

T

, (k > i)

where Pk is a matrix of size dk2 О dk whose ((s - 1)dk + s, s) (s = 1, и и и , dk) entry equal to (us(k))(1 - (us(k)))(1 - 2(u(sk))) and rest entries are all 0. When k = i,

vec G(u(k)) w(k)

vec G(u(k)) u(k) = u(k) w(k) = Pk

(v(k-1))T  Idk

 R .d2kОdkdk-1

Note

that

for

k

<

i,

we

have

 G(u(k) )
 w(i)

=

0.

For

brevity,

let

Dk

v(j-1)(v(l) - y)T BkT+1:l  G(u(j))Bj+1:k-1WkT (k = i, и и и , l).

(25)

Therefore, we have

Q2ij = DiPi (v(i-1))T  Idi

l
+ DkPk
k=i+1

(v(i-1))T  G(u(i))Bi+1:k-1(W (k))T T

.

Then we consider Qi3j.

Qi3j = v(j-1)(v(l) - y)T BTi+1:lG(u(i))  G(u(j))Bj+1:i-1 .

Also

we

can

use

the

computation

of

 v (l)  w(i)

in

Lemma

23

and

compute

Qi4j

as

follows:

Q4ij =v(j-1) 

G(u(j))Bj+1:l

(v(l) - y) w(Ti)

= v(j-1)  G(u(j))Bj+1:l

(v(i-1))T  G(u(i))Bi+1:l T

.

Finally, since i > j, we can compute Q5ij = 0.

Case

II:

i

=

j.

We

first

consider

: G(u(k) )
 w(k)

vec G(u(k)) w(Tk)

vec G(u(k)) u(k) = u(k) w(Tk) = Pk

(v(k-1))T  Idk

 R ,d2kОdkdk-1

where Pk is a matrix of size d2k Оdk whose (s, (s-1)dk +s) entry equal to (us(k))(1-(us(k)))(1- 2(u(sk))) and rest entries are all 0. Q1jj can be computed as

Q1jj =

v(j-1)(v(l) - y)T BjT+1:l

 Idj

vec G(u(j)) w(Tj)

= v(j-1)(v(l) - y)T BTj+1:l  Idj

Pj (v(j-1))T  Idj .

As for Qj2j, by Eqn. (25) we have

l

Qj2j =

Dk Pk

k=j+1

v(j-1))T  G(u(j))Bj+1:k-1(W (k))T T

.

Since i = j, Qj3j does not exist. For convenience, we just set Qj3j = 0.

40

Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2018

Now we consider Q4jj which can be computed as follows:

Q4jj =v(j-1) 

G(u(j))Bj+1:l

(v(l) -y) w(Tj)

= v(j-1)  G(u(j))Bj+1:l

T
(v(j-1))T  G(u(j))Bj+1:l

.

Finally, since i = j, we can compute Qj5j = 0.

Case

III:

i

<

j.

Since

2f (w,x) wwT

is

symmetrical,

we

have

Qkij

=

Qkji

(k

=

1, и и и

, 5).

Step 2. Bound the operation norm of Hessian: We mainly use Lemma 22 to achieve this goal. From Lemma 22, we have

(1) For arbitrary matrices M and N of proper size, we have

G(u(i))M

2 F



1 16

M

2 F

and

N G(u(i))

2 F

and

N Pk

N

.

(3) For Bs:t and Ds:t, we have

Bs:t

and

1 16t-s+1

Ds:t



cr ,

where cr = max

r2 16

(4) For arbitrary matrices M , N and I of proper sizes, let m = vec (M ). Then we have

and

(I

The values of entries in v(h) are bounded by 0  (u(hi))  1 which leads to

v(h)

2 F

cd,

where cd = maxi di. On the other hand, since the values in v(l) belong to the range [0, 1] and y is

the label,

v(l) - y

2 2

can

be

bounded:

v(l) - y

2 2

where cy is a universal constant.

We first define

Ckij = DkPk

v(i-1))T 

T
G(u(i))Bi+1:k-1(W (k))T

and Cij =DiPi (v(i-1))T  Idi =

v(i-1)  Idi (DiPi)T T =x v(i-1)  (DiPi)T T

=(v(i-1))T  (DiPi) , where Dk is defined in Eqn. (25). x holds since for an arbitrary vector u  Rk and an arbitrary matrix M  RkОk, we have (u  Ik) M = u  M .

Case I: i > j. According to the definition of Cij and Ckij, we have Q2ij = Cij +

So

we have

We complete the proof.

D.2.3 PROOF OF LEMMA 18

For convenience, we first give the computation of some gradients.

Lemma 24. Assume the activation functions in deep neural network are sigmoid functions. Then we

can compute the gradients

 u(j )  u(1)

and

 v (j )  u(1)

as

u(j) u(1) = v(j) u(1) =

T
G(u(1))A2 и и и Aj-1(W j )T  RdjОd1 , (j > 1). G(u(1))A2 и и и Aj T  RdjОd1 , (j > 1).

It should be pointed out that the proof of Lemma 24 can be founded Sec. D.4.

Proof. To prove our conclusion, we have two steps: computing xwf (w, x) and bounding its operation norm.

Step 1. Compute xwf (w, x):

We

first

consider

the

computation

of

2f (w,x) xT w(j)

:

2f (w, x)  vec xT w(j) =

G(u(j))Aj+1Aj+2 и и и Al(v(l) - y) (v(j-1))T xT

.

Recall that we define
Ai = (W (i))T G(u(i))  Rdi-1Оdi . Bs:t = AsAs+1 и и и At  Rds-1Оdt , (s  t) and Bs:t = I, (s > t).

Then we have

2f (w, x) xT w(j) =

v(j-1)(v(l) - y)T BjT+1:l

 Idj

vec G(u(j)) xT (

Qj1)

l

v(j-1)(v(l) - y)T BTk+1:l  G(u(j))Bj+1:k-1WkT

k=j+1

(v(l) - y) xT (

Qj3)

+ Idj-1 

G(u(j))Bj+1:l(v(l) - y)

 v (j -1) xT (

Qj4)

By using Lemma 24, we can compute Q1ij as

vec G(u(k)) xT (

Q2j )

vec G(u(k)) xT

vec G(u(k)) u(k) = u(k) xT = Pk

G(u(1))B2:k-1(W k)T

T
.

Thus, we have

Q1j = =

T j+1:l

vec G(u(j))

 Idj

xT

v(j-1)(v(l) - y)T BjT+1:l  Idj Pk G(u(1))B2:k-1(W k)T

T
.

44

As for Qj2, we also can utilize Lemma 24 to compute it:

l
Qj2 =

v(j-1)(v(l)

T k+1:l



G(u(j))Bj+1:k-1WkT

B

T k+1:l

T
Pk G(u(1))B2:k-1(W k)T .

Then we consider Qi3j.

Qj3 = v(j-1) 

G(u(j))Bj+1:l

(v(l) - y) xT =

v(j-1) 

G(u(j))Bj+1:l

T
G(u(1))B2:l .

Q4j can be computed as follows:

Qj4 = Idj-1  G(u(j))Bj+1:l(v(l) -y)

 v (j -1) xT =

Idj-1  G(u(j))Bj+1:l(v(l) -y)

T
G(u(1))B2:j .

Step 2. Bound the operation norm of Hessian: We mainly use Lemma 22 to achieve this goal. From Lemma 22, we have

(1) For arbitrary matrices M and N of proper size, we have

G(u(i))M

2 F



1 16

M

2 F

and

N G(u(i))

2 F

(2) For arbitrary matrices M and N of proper size, we have

Pk M

26 38

2 F

and

N Pk

2 F



26 38

N

2 F

.

(3) For Bs:t and Ds:t, we have

Bs:t

2 F

and

1 16t-s+1

Ds:t



cr ,

where cr = max

r2 4

(4) For arbitrary matrices M , N and I of proper sizes, let m = vec (M ). Then we have

and

(I

The values of entries in v(h) are bounded by 0  (uh(i))  1 which leads to

v(h)

2 F

cd,

where cd = maxi di. On the other hand, since the values in v(l) belong to the range [0, 1] and y is

the label,

v(l) - y

can

be

bounded:

v(l) - y

where cy is a universal constant.

We first define Ckj = v(j-1)(v(l) - y)T BkT+1:l  G(u(j))Bj+1:k-1WkT

D.2.4 PROOF OF LEMMAS 19 AND 20

Lemma 25. (Alessandro, 2016; Rigollet, 2015) Let (x1, и и и , xk) be a vector of i.i.d. Gaussian variables from N (0,  2) and let f : Rd0  R be L-Lipschitz. Then the variable f (x) - Ef (x) is sub-Gaussian. That is, we have

P (f (x) - Ef (x) > t)  exp

- t2 2L2 2

,

(t  0),

or E ((f (x) - Ef (x)))  exp 42L2 2 , (  0).

Remarkably, this is a dimension free inequality.

Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2018

Proof of Lemma 19. We first define a function g(x) = zT wf (w, x) where z  Rd is a constant vector. Then we have xg(x) = x zT wf (w, x) = xwf (w, x)z. Then by Lemma 18, we

can obtain xg(x) 2 = xwf (w, x)z 2   z 2, where  =

2)cy cr cd

(lcr

in which cy, cd and cr are defined in Lemma 18. This means g(x) is  z 2-Lipschitz. Thus, by

Lemma 25, we have

E (t

z, wf (w, x) - Ewf (w, x) ) = E (t (g(x) - Eg(x)))  exp

4t22

z

.

Let  = tz. This further gives

E ( , wf (w, x) - Ewf (w, x) )  exp

42 2



2 2

,

which means , wf (w, x) - Ewf (w, x) is 82 2-sub-Gaussian.

Proof of Lemma 20. We first define a function h(x) = zT w2 f (w, x)z where z  Sd-1, i.e. z 2 = 1. Then h(w) is a -Lipschitz function, where  = xw2 f (w, x) op. Note that since the sigmoid function is infinitely differentiable function, xw2 f (w, x) exists. Also since for any input x, (x) belongs to [0, 1]. Thus, the values of the entries in xw2 f (w, x) can be bounded. So according to the definition of the operation norm of a 3-way tensor, the operation norm of xw2 f (w, x) can be bounded by a constant. Without loss of generality, let x2wf (w, x) op   < +. Thus, by Lemma 25, we have

E t z, 2wf (w, x) - Ew2 f (w, x) z

= E (t (h(x) - Eh(x)))  exp

8t22 2 2

.

This means that the hessian of the loss evaluated on a unit vector is 82 2-sub-Gaussian.

D.2.5 PROOF OF LEMMA 21

Proof. Recall that the weight of each layer has magnitude bound separately, i.e. w(j) 2  r.

Assume that w(j) has sj non-zero entries. Then we have

l j=1

sj

=

s.

So

here

we

separately

assume

wj = {w1j, и и и , wnj j } is the djdj-1 /d-covering net of the ball Bdjdj-1 (r) which corresponds

to the weight w(j) of the j-th layer. Let n j be the /l-covering number. By -covering theory in

(Vershynin, 2012), we can have

3r sj  exp

Let w   be an arbitrary vector. Since w = [w(1), и и и , w(l)] where w(j) is the weight of the j-th layer, we can always find a vector wkjj in wj such that w(j) - wkjj 2  djdj-1 /d. For brevity, let jw  [n j] denote the index of wkjj in -net wj. Then let wkw = [wkj1 ; и и и ; wkjj ; и и и ; wkjl ]. This means that we can always find a vector wkw such that w - wkw 2  . Accordingly, we can

Accordingly, we have P (E0)  P (E1) + P (E2) + P (E3) .
So we can respectively bound P (E1), P (E2) and P (E3) to bound P (E0).

For brevity, let jw  [n j] denote the index of wkjj in -net wj. Then let wkw = [wkj1 ; и и и ; wkjj ; и и и ; wkjl ]. This means that we can always find a vector wkw such that w - wkw 2  .

Proof. Suppose that {w(1), w(2), и и и , w(m)} are the non-degenerate critical points of J (w). So for any w(k), it obeys

inf
i

ki

2J (w(k))

 ,

where ki 2J (w(k)) denotes the i-th eigenvalue of the Hessian 2J (w(k)) and  is a constant. We further define a set D = {w  Rd | J (w) 2  and infi |i 2J (w(k)) |  }. According
to Lemma 4, D = k=1Dk where each Dk is a disjoint component with w(k)  Dk for k  m and Dk does not contain any critical point of J (w) for k  m + 1. On the other hand, by the continuity of J (w), it yields J (w) 2 = for w  Dk. Notice, we set the value of blow which is actually a function related n.

Then by utilizing Theorem 4, we let sample number n sufficient large such that

sup J^n(w) - J (w)

This means that in each set Dk, 2J^n(w) has no zero eigenvalues. Then, combining this and Eqn. (26), by Lemma 3 we know that if the population risk J (w) has no critical point in Dk, then the empirical risk J^n(w) has also no critical point in Dk; otherwise it also holds. By Lemma 3, we can also obtain that in Dk, if J (w) has a unique critical point w(k) with non-degenerate index sk, then J^n(w) also has a unique critical point wn(k) in Dk with the same non-degenerate index sk. The
first conclusion is proved.

Now we bound the distance between the corresponding critical points of J (w) and J^n(w). Assume that in Dk, J (w) has a unique critical point w(k) and J^n(w) also has a unique critical point wn(k). Then, there exists t  [0, 1] such that for any z  Bd(1), we have

D.3.3 PROOF OF THEOREM 6

Proof. Recall that the weight of each layer has magnitude bound separately, i.e. w(j) 2  r.

Assume that w(j) has sj non-zero entries. Then we have

l j=1

sj

=

s.

So

here

we

separately

assume

wj = {w1j, и и и , wnj j } is the djdj-1 /d-covering net of the ball Bdjdj-1 (r) which corresponds

54

Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2018

to the weight w(j) of the j-th layer. Let n j be the /l-covering number. By -covering theory in (Vershynin, 2012), we can have

nj

dj dj-1 sj

3r sj  exp
dj dj-1 /(ld)

sj log

3rdj dj-1 dj dj-1 /d

3rd = exp sj log

.

Let w   be an arbitrary vector. Since w = [w(1), и и и , w(l)] where w(j) is the weight of the j-th layer, we can always find a vector wkjj in wj such that w(j) - wkjj 2  djdj-1 /d. For brevity, let jw  [n j] denote the index of wkjj in -net wj. Then let wkw = [wkj1 ; и и и ; wkjj ; и и и ; wkjl ]. This means that we can always find a vector wkw such that w - wkw 2  . Accordingly, we can
decompose J^n(w) - J (w) as

J^n(w) - J (w) =

1 n

f (w, x(i)) - E(f (w, x))

i=1

Then, we define four events E0, E1, E2 and E3 as

Accordingly, we have

P (E0)  P (E1) + P (E2) + P (E3) .

So we can respectively bound P (E1), P (E2) and P (E3) to bound P (E0).

Step 1. Bound P (E1): We first bound P (E1) as follows:

Step 2. Bound P (E2): Recall that we use jw to denote the index of wkjj in -net wj and we have jw  [n j], (n j  exp sj log 3rd . We can bound P (E2) as follows:

P (E2) =P

Since when the activation functions are sigmoid functions, the loss f (w, x) is -Lipschitz. Besides,

we assume x to be a vector of i.i.d. Gaussian variables from N (0,  2). Then by Lemma 25, we know

that the variable f (x) - Ef (x) is 82 2-sub-Gaussian. Thus, we have

P (|f (x) - Ef (x)| > t)  2 exp

D.4 PROOF OF OTHER LEMMAS

D.4.1 PROOF OF LEMMA 22

Proof. Since G(u(i)) is a diagonal matrix and its diagonal values are upper bounded by (u(hi))(1 - (uh(i)))  1/4 where uh(i) denotes the h-th entry of u(i), we can conclude

By utilizing the chain rule in Eqn. (24) in Sec. D.2.1, we can easily compute

f (w,x)  u(i)

follows:

f (w, x) u(i)

that

we
